## 1, ‘Her tears were real’: survivors of Christchurch attack weigh up Jacinda Ardern’s legacy

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/25/christchurch-attack-survivors-on-jacinda-ardern-legacy-as-new-zealand-pm

> Ardern’s response to the shooting at two mosques is considered by many to be the defining moment in her time as New Zealand prime minister

When Temel Ataçocuğu regained consciousness in hospital after being shot nine times during a white supremacist terror attack, a friend showed him a video of New Zealand’s prime minister responding to the horror.

“Many of those who will have been directly affected by this shooting may be migrants to New Zealand, they may even be refugees here. They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home,” Ardern said, in a speech that reverberated around the world.

“They are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not. They have no place in New Zealand,” Ardern said.

Fifty-one Muslims were killed during Friday prayers when an Australian man opened fire on two Christchurch mosques. Dozens more were injured.

“She didn’t talk like we were from different faiths or different nationalities,” says Ataçocuğu. “It felt like we were part of New Zealand.”

Ardern soon visited him in hospital and a friendship began between her and the Turkish New Zealander that “feels more like a brother-sister relationship”, he says.

“I could see from her eyes that she was feeling what she said,” adds Ataçocuğu. “She was so sorry.”

Her empathy, rejection of violent rhetoric, and swift action to ban almost all semi-automatic weapons in New Zealand after the 15 March 2019 attack was for much of the world the defining moment of her premiership.

Ardern’s actions prompted a global conversation about the new kind of leader she represented. But for the survivors and those bereaved in the attack, her words signalled something more existential – and simple.

“I felt more welcome even though I’ve been here for a long time,” says Rashid Omar, whose son, Tariq, was killed in the attack. He learned of Ardern’s remarks in a haze of grief, weeks later.

“All I can say is that her compassion and her tears were real,” he says.

For Maysoon Salama, whose son, Atta, was killed and husband injured, Ardern’s easy adoption of words such as shuhada (martyrs) and masjidain (mosques) stood in contrast to other world leaders who spoke of Muslims as terrorists.

“She gave value to Arabic words and allowed us to reclaim those Arabic terminologies,” Salama says. She applauded Ardern’s decision to wear the hijab in solidarity with Muslims and her refusal to ever say the terrorist’s name.

Media reports that single out Ardern as the main hero in the crisis have at times perturbed New Zealanders, who feel it detracts from those who were targeted and gives undue credit to a political leader for a measured response that should not have felt extraordinary.

But many of the survivors say the attack’s inflammatory factors – its far-right motivations, the targeting of a relatively safe country and the fact it was live-streamed on the internet – intensified the global spotlight and the significance of Ardern’s response.

“The immediate aftermath shook us to the core and I was concerned about how worried we needed to be … while juggling the aftermath of my brother’s murder,” says Aya al-Umari, whose brother, Hussein, was killed.

The prime minister’s words were a reassurance that “we are in safe hands,” al-Umari says.

Ardern developed a particularly close bond with the women bereaved in the attack – including 31 widows – and many have written her letters of thanks since her resignation last week.

For al-Umari’s mother, Janna Ezat, a favourite memory of Ardern came after Ezat gave a statement in court at the terrorist’s sentencing, during which she offered her forgiveness to her son’s murderer.

Her remarks prompted a gift from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: a square metre from the cloth covering the kaaba – the structure at the centre of Islam’s most important mosque, in Mecca.

Thrilled, Ezat took the fabric to a meeting with Ardern, explaining to her that it was a gift usually reserved for diplomats and royalty.

“Jacinda replied, ‘In that case, you are the Queen,’” al-Umari says. “Grief is a very dark journey and these moments just shine a nice light along the way.”

The relationship between Ardern and the families has at times been tinged by frustration when they felt the government response did not align with her lofty rhetoric in the days after the attack. Lingering questions remain for many about how the mass shooting was able to happen and how the devastated community will be supported – and protected – in the future.

“The sense of urgency was there in the beginning but it dwindled,” al-Umari says. “I think it’s primarily to do with the absence of accountability, which was in turn reflected in the public sector’s delivery of answers.”

But she and others say Ardern made time for them and their families in a way that went beyond what they expected. During one meeting with officials, Omar says, the prime minister insisted that she have time just to talk to the families.

“She said, ‘I want to see my friends,’” says Omar. “She had a cup of tea but I don’t think she got to drink any because she was so bombarded with everyone wanting to talk to her.”

The bereaved and survivors must now begin a new relationship with Ardern’s successor, Chris Hipkins, says Omar, a spokesperson for the 15 March Whānau Trust which represents dozens of those affected. “Hopefully the new prime minister can deliver the same compassion and understanding,” he says.

The survivors say they understand why Ardern was too exhausted to continue and that the traumatic stories she heard in her long conversations with them would have taken a heavy toll.

“She’s human and I think she deserves some time off,” Ataçocuğu says. “I hope she comes back because she’s a great leader.”

In the meantime, he was hopeful Ardern might stay in touch.

“I hope she visits me in Christchurch with her family,” he says. “We can go to a cafe and sit and chat, just as two friends.”

Last updates on the Christchurch shooting
New Zealand shooting: what we know so far
‘Multiple fatalities’ after gunman opens fire in Christchurch mosque shooting


The New Zealand prime minister has given a short speech responding to the shooting at mosques in Christchurch that has left several people dead.

Jacinda Ardern said the incident was “one of New Zealand’s darkest days” and that the victims had chosen to make New Zealand their home. “They are us,” she said. “The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not.”

Here are her comments:

“Whilst I cannot give any confirmation at this stage around fatalities and casualties, what I can say is that it is clear that this is one of New Zealand’s darkest days.

Clearly, what has happened here is an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence.

Many of those who will have been directly affected by this shooting may be migrants to New Zealand, they may even be refugees here. They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home.

They are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not. They have no place in New Zealand. There is no place in New Zealand for such acts of extreme and unprecedented violence, which it is clear this act was.

For now, my thoughts, and I’m sure the thoughts of all New Zealanders, are with those who have been affected, and also with their families.

My thoughts also to those in Christchurch, who are still dealing with an unfolding situation. The advice from police continues to be that people remain indoors. I acknowledge that that may mean that some families are separated, but please continue to listen out for information as it comes to light that’s been directly provided by the New Zealand Police with further information.

But as I say, please remain in lockdown. We are potentially still dealing with an evolving situation. And again, as I say, across multiple sites. Please be assured, though, the police are actively managing the situation. Christchurch Hospital is dedicated to treating those who are arriving at the hospital as we speak as well.

As soon as I leave here, I will be returning directly on a flight to Wellington. Agencies are already convening in Wellington. I will be looking to meet with them as soon as I land. It’s my expectation that once I arrive and have been briefed, I intend to speak again publicly after that point. I’m happy to take questions.”

## 3, With respect: how Jacinda Ardern showed the world what a leader should be

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/28/with-respect-how-jacinda-ardern-showed-the-world-what-a-leader-should-be

> Her empathy for the survivors of the Christchurch shooting, her swift implementation of practical measures and her refusal to be sucked into anti-Islamic rhetoric provide a lesson other countries should follow

There was something both comforting and distressing about the way the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, consoled her country’s Muslim community after the Christchurch mosque attack. Comforting because here, for once, was a normal human reaction; not robotic or platitudinous, not scripted or insincere. She hugged Muslim men, just as she did women, with a comfort that betrayed no self-consciousness. The power of her response came not only from her warm physical embrace of the survivors and families of victims, but also from symbolic gestures such as wearing the hijab and refusing to use the name of the chief suspect. This was backed up with the right messaging and followed swiftly with practical measures, such as new gun legislation.

It is a marvel to see a response so well calibrated. But it shouldn’t be. This is the distressing dimension of Ardern’s compassionate poise, that it is so unfamiliar, so rare. At a time when governments in Europe and the United States are either brazenly anti-Muslim and xenophobic, or at best silent on the matter of immigration and Islam, what should be the norm is elevated to exceptional. It is a sign of the times that Muslims feel grateful for Ardern’s outreach, and that the world is lauding her for a response that should come easily to any head of state whose citizens have been slaughtered. Already, thousands of signatures have been collected to nominate Ardern for the Nobel peace prize. Her empathy brings the shortcomings of others into relief. Her performance was impressive, but the bar is low.

It is hard not to compare Ardern with her counterparts. Take Theresa May, a woman whose flawed response to the Grenfell tragedy sealed her reputation as someone so emotionally distant that she was unable to see that a prime minister’s place is to comfort the bereaved, rather than mingle with a handful of members of the emergency services flanked by security. But Ardern not only displayed a temperamental superiority, she reminded us that being a head of government is a responsibility that one must rise to, regardless of public sentiment on immigration and Muslims, or how one’s response will be perceived.

May’s tenure at the Home Office and since as prime minister revealed a politician who never failed to miss a populist beat, relishing the ending of freedom of movement, deriding “citizens of nowhere” – and, in her speech last week, barely stopping short of inciting the public against parliament.

In the United States, there is still a “Muslim ban” in effect – a travel blockade that applies to citizens of Muslim-majority countries, which builds on Donald Trump’s election pledge for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims” entering the US. Trump continues to pass on every opportunity to confront and condemn the threat of white supremacist ideology and it is inconceivable that the deaths of Muslims would be treated with the sanctity and respect shown in New Zealand.

Ardern herself, in her comprehensive response to the tragedy, appeared as a rebuke to the failures of others. It was as if she had done her homework, and ticked off every factor that had led to the Christchurch shooting that had been underaddressed or minimised by other politicians in her position. When she wore the hijab, I initially felt it was an inappropriate symbolic gesture, because it seemed to presume it was the sole definer of Muslim identity, yet she made a compelling case for it in an interview. It was meant to show solidarity with those most visible and hence most vulnerable to attack, she explained. “If in wearing the hijab as I did gave them a sense of security to continue to practice their faith, then I’m very pleased I did it,” she said.

But, most importantly, she moved beyond the gestures, asking the bereaved what her government could do rather than deciding on their behalf how resources are allocated. “Our time is for you to determine,” she told them.

Then she proceeded to address other world leaders by saying: “There are some things we need to confront collectively as leaders internationally.” She specifically mentioned social media and broached the topic of regulation. “We cannot, for instance, allow some of the challenges we face with social media to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis,” she said, demanding that tech platforms take responsibility.

In a pointed remark to Trump when he called to console her and offer assistance, she asked only for “sympathy and love for all Muslim communities”. And at the same time as she disowned the suspected attacker, she also attempted to reverse the narrative that it was immigrants, or outsiders, who agitate white natives into restiveness. She seemed to cover all the issues that many Muslims privately and publicly cautioned against, the complacency about hate speech online, the lassitude when it came to confronting Islamophobia head on, and the marriage between Muslim-bashing, racism and anti-immigration.

Again, this is a welcome approach and a sad indication that it is only when others advocate on behalf of Muslims, that their concerns are heard or adopted. Filtered through the image of Ardern, Muslims’ humanity was given focus.

The overall show of respect in New Zealand also bucked a trend of not treating attacks against Muslims with the same sense of panic and urgency as other terrorist incidents. As attacks on British mosques increased in the last decade, few were met with the same mobilisation that would be expected if the assailants were Muslim.

Even in the week since the Christchurch attacks, hate crimes against Muslims have increased by almost 600% in the UK. They included attacks on mosques and one alleged stabbing, and yet there has been no comforting address from the Home Office or No 10. It was only after pressure from British Muslim community leaders at a memorial event for Christchurch victims, that security funding for mosques in the UK was increased to bring it in line with that provided for Jewish places of worship.

What sets Ardern apart is that she is a moral politician in a small country that allows for no-frills leadership. Her no-nonsense election slogan was “Let’s do this”. But she still presides over a country where anti-Muslim sentiment is rising, and, according to the New Zealand Human Rights Commission, reported instances of racism are also on the rise, with a third of all complaints to the commission regarding racist discrimination.

Ardern, who leads the Labour party, has clearly made a choice to stand against this. There is a similar effort in Canada and Ireland.

At the one-year anniversary of the Quebec mosque shootings in which six worshippers died, Justin Trudeau made the important link between the ubiquity and danger of small hatreds. In his speech, he observed that discrimination was becoming “commonplace” or “even tolerated”. In parliament, he pointed out that the Quebec tragedy was preventable. “It should never have come to this point. We cannot bring back those who perished, but we owe it to them to fight the very sentiment that caused their loss. We owe it to them to speak up and stand tall and explicitly against Islamophobia and discrimination in all its forms,” he said.

The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, regularly sends supportive welcome messages to a new wave of migrants and refugees that has arrived in Ireland, particularly from the Middle East. When Brian Murphy, a member of Varadkar’s party, Fine Gael, tweeted anti-immigration statements and dog whistle references to sharia law, there was little foot-dragging. Murphy tweeted: “The Irish military should not be being forced to act as a ferry service for smugglers and illegal economic migrants in the Mediterranean.” And: “Sharia law is operating in Ireland and most of the political class either do not know or do not care. It is a subversion of our legal system.” Varadkar responded by saying: “I want to disassociate myself and the party from those messages from Cllr Brian Murphy. They do not represent the policies, views or values of the Fine Gael party.” The whip has since been removed from Murphy.

None of these individual politicians’ efforts alone will vanquish racism or Islamophobia, but it is a start of a counternarrative that has been missing for far too long.

Consider again, the unfortunate contrast with May’s Conservative party, dogged by accusations of institutional Islamophobia and not only refusing to do much that is decisive, but retrenching in its denial that there is a problem. It is hard not to conclude, after years of Tory party members blowing the whistle, that this is a deliberate obstruction. Under May’s premiership, the Conservative party has reaped the electoral benefits of the hostile environment and Brexit’s xenophobic tailwind. Taking a strong stand against Islamophobia within its ranks would not be very on-brand.

In contrast, instead of following the public mood or hedging against it, Ardern led it. Female reporters, presenters and police officers followed her lead in wearing the hijab, and many spontaneous public shows of support took place, in schools and on the streets.

In the most poignant gesture, at the first Friday prayers after the attack, non-Muslims, including a notorious biker mob, stood guard to ensure the safety of worshippers, proving that the public and the media can take their cue from powerful politicians and not succumb inexorably to anti-immigrant racist sentiment. This is a mistake that many centre and left-of-centre politicians make: the assumption that popular antipathy towards immigrants came first, and agitating populist parties came second. Populist parties merely did the work, with little challenge from mainstream politicians, who were either too afraid to come out in support of immigrants in case it was a vote loser, or tried to beat populists at their own game. Ardern is doing the work.

Her success, however, is not to be measured in how she has handled and emerged from this crisis, but in the consistency of her work to combat racism and Islamophobia, in all its complicated slippery ways, from the trenches of social media to the corridors of the White House. Her success will be to no longer be exceptional.

## 4, The key moments of Jacinda Ardern’s time as prime minister

> From her response to the Christchurch mosque attacks and Covid to becoming a mother while in office, Ardern attracted headlines worldwide

Tell us: how will you remember Jacinda Ardern’s time as PM?


Since her election in 2017, New Zealand has faced multiple crises, and her leadership has attracted headlines across the world. Here are some of the key aspects of her time in office.

In the uncertain hours after the Christchurch mosque attacks of 15 March 2019, Ardern emphasised that the victims of the massacre were beloved, integral members of the New Zealand community. The attacker was not.

“Many of those who will have been directly affected by this shooting may be migrants to New Zealand, they may even be refugees here. They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home.

“They are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not,” Ardern said. “They have no place in New Zealand. There is no place in New Zealand for such acts of extreme and unprecedented violence, which it is clear this act was.”

The violent shooting attack on two Christchurch mosques by a lone Australian terrorist, which killed 51 people, was the cataclysmic event of Ardern’s premiership, and her response to it its defining act.

Ardern wore a hijab as she sat with survivors and the families of victims, and emphasising her country’s solidarity with them.

“Speak the names of those who were lost rather than the man who took them,” she said. “He may seek notoriety but we will give him nothing, not even his name.”

In the immediate aftermath, Ardern moved to tighten New Zealand’s gun laws, banning military-style semi-automatic weapons just six days after the attack. More than 62,000 firearms were ultimately removed from circulation through a gun buy-back scheme.

And she became an outspoken campaigner to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online, spearheading – alongside the French president, Emmanuel Macron – the Christchurch Call to Action.

All premierships since 2020 will be marked, in some way, against the scorecard of Covid-19. Ardern, helped by New Zealand’s island nation geography and relatively robust public health system, was widely praised for a “world-leading” response, but significantly thanked her “team of 5 million” New Zealanders for their support, and the sacrifices they had made.

New Zealand’s Covid-19 response – an initial strategy of elimination (which included border closures and lockdown) transitioning to a mitigation strategy – has kept infections and deaths low.

In the first 18 months of the pandemic, until vaccines became widely available, New Zealand had low Covid-19 mortality rates: life expectancy actually increased. To January 2023, the country has recorded fewer than 2,500 deaths in total from the pandemic.

Pockets of disaffection have remained tenacious – a small core of conspiracy-prone anti-government protesters occupied parliament’s lawns for weeks in 2022, some threatening violence – but Ardern’s response was widely seen as having saved lives.

Further tragedy was visited upon New Zealand in December 2019, when Whakaari/White Island erupted, killing 21 people, including tourists from the UK, US, Australia, China and Malaysia.

Ardern met first responders in Whakatāne, praising the helicopter pilots who flew to the island in the immediate aftermath of the eruption to rescue those stranded. The pilots, Ardern said, made “an incredibly brave decision under extraordinary, dangerous circumstances in an attempt to get people out”.

She later told parliament: “I say to those who have lost and grieve – you are forever linked to our nation and we will hold you close”.

In the early months of her premiership, there was a word for it: “Jacindamania”. Ardern was celebrated around the world, alongside Macron and Canada’s Justin Trudeau, as a progressive riposte to the rise of Donald Trump in the US.

Ardern was featured on the cover of British Vogue, replete with glamorous photoshoot inside. She appeared repeatedly on the American TV host Stephen Colbert’s Late Show, and made Time magazine’s list of 100 of the world’s “most influential people”.

She became only the second world leader to give birth while in office (Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto was first, in 1990). She took her infant daughter, Neve, to the UN general assembly in New York. All attracted attention, bordering on adulation.

But fame was occasionally a double-edged sword. Ardern faced repeated intrusive questioning about her personal life – her pregnancy, her partner, her hair. And when she met the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, she was interrogated as to whether they’d only met because they were both young female prime ministers.

“I wonder whether or not anyone ever asked Barack Obama and John Key if they met because they were of similar age,” she mused in response.

In 2022, Ardern earned a standing ovation – and again made global headlines – for a commencement speech to students at Harvard University, urging a defence of “fragile” democracy against a rising tide of authoritarianism and intolerance.

“This imperfect but precious way that we organise ourselves, that has been created to give equal voice to the weak and to the strong, that is designed to help drive consensus. It is fragile.”

Ardern’s premiership has also been marked by domestic policy disappointments as her party stumbled over reforms to housing, waterways and agriculture.

Economic headwinds have buffeted New Zealand’s economy. Inflation hit 7.2% in 2022 (with grocery costs rising more than 10%), forcing New Zealand’s reserve bank to plan a “shallow recession” for the country. Interest rates were lifted, putting further pressure on household budgets, and petrol prices spiked.

KiwiBuild, the Ardern government’s much-touted intervention into the housing market, was ambitious – 100,000 homes by 2028 – but ultimately a failure.

Growing concern about crime further fuelled discontent, and New Zealanders grew more pessimistic during the second half of Ardern’s tenure. In early 2021, a poll showed 70% of New Zealanders “think the country is going in the right direction”. By the end of 2022, that figure was 30%.

Jacinda Ardern given standing ovation at New Zealand service


“E rau rangatira mā, e ngā reo, e ngā mana. Tēnā koutou katoa.

(I acknowledge amongst us today our distinguished leaders, speakers and those who bear authority.)

Ngāi Tahu Whānui, tēnā koutou.

(My greetings to the whole of Ngāi Tahu.)

E papaki tū ana ngā tai o maumahara ki runga o Ōtautahi.

(The tides of remembrance flow over Christchurch today.)

Haere mai tātou me te aroha, me te rangimārie, ki te whānau nei, e ora mārire ai anō rātau, e ora mārire ai anō, tātou katoa.

(So let us gather with love, in peace, for this family, so that they may truly live again, so that we all may truly live again.)

We gather here, 14 days on from our darkest of hours. In the days that have followed the terrorist attack on the 15th of March, we have often found ourselves without words.

What words adequately express the pain and suffering of 50 men, women and children lost, and so many injured? What words capture the anguish of our Muslim community being the target of hatred and violence? What words express the grief of a city that has already known so much pain?

I thought there were none. And then I came here and was met with this simple greeting. As-salaam Alaikum. Peace be upon you.

They were simple words, repeated by community leaders who witnessed the loss of their friends and loved ones. Simple words, whispered by the injured from their hospital beds. Simple words, spoken by the bereaved and everyone I met who has been affected by this attack.

As-salaam Alaikum. Peace be upon you.

They were words spoken by a community who, in the face of hate and violence, had every right to express anger but instead opened their doors for all of us to grieve with them. And so we say to those who have lost the most, we may not have always had the words.

We may have left flowers, performed the haka, sung songs or simply embraced. But even when we had no words, we still heard yours, and they have left us humbled and they have left us united.

Over the past two weeks we have heard the stories of those impacted by this terrorist attack. They were stories of bravery. They were stories of those who were born here, grew up here, or who had made New Zealand their home. Who had sought refuge, or sought a better life for themselves or their families.

These stories, they now form part of our collective memories. They will remain with us forever. They are us.

But with that memory comes a responsibility. A responsibility to be the place that we wish to be. A place that is diverse, that is welcoming, that is kind and compassionate. Those values represent the very best of us.

But even the ugliest of viruses can exist in places they are not welcome. Racism exists, but it is not welcome here. An assault on the freedom of any one of us who practices their faith or religion, is not welcome here. Violence, and extremism in all its forms, is not welcome here. And over the last two weeks we have shown that, you have shown that, in your actions.

From the thousands at vigils to the 95 year old man who took four buses to attend a rally because he couldn’t sleep from the sadness of seeing the hurt and suffering of others. Our challenge now is to make the very best of us, a daily reality.

Because we are not immune to the viruses of hate, of fear, of other. We never have been. But we can be the nation that discovers the cure.

And so to each of us as we go from here, we have work to do, but do not leave the job of combatting hate to the government alone. We each hold the power, in our words and in our actions, in our daily acts of kindness. Let that be the legacy of the 15th of March. To be the nation we believe ourselves to be.

To the global community who have joined us today, who reached out to embrace New Zealand, and our Muslim community, to all of those who have gathered here today, we say thank you.

And we also ask that the condemnation of violence and terrorism turns now to a collective response. The world has been stuck in a vicious cycle of extremism breeding extremism and it must end.

We cannot confront these issues alone, none of us can. But the answer to them lies in a simple concept that is not bound by domestic borders, that isn’t based on ethnicity, power base or even forms of governance. The answer lies in our humanity.

But for now, we will remember those who have left this place. We will remember the first responders who gave so much of themselves to save others.

We will remember the tears of our nation, and the new resolve we have formed.

And we remember, that ours is a home that does not and cannot claim perfection. But we can strive to be true to the words embedded in our national anthem

Men of every creed and race,Gather here before Thy face,Asking Thee to bless this placeGod defend our free land

From dissension, envy, hateAnd corruption, guard our stateMake our country good and greatGod defend New Zealand

Ko tātou tātou

As-salaam Alaikum

## 6, Ardern says she will never speak name of Christchurch suspect

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/19/new-zealand-shooting-ardern-says-she-will-never-speak-suspects-name

> New Zealand leader calls on public to speak names of mosque attack victims instead

Jacinda Ardern has said she will render the person accused over the Christchurch terrorist attack “nameless” and urged the public to speak the victims’ names instead.

Addressing parliament for the first time since Friday’s attack, the New Zealand prime minister said the accused would face “the full force of the law in New Zealand” but that she would never speak his name.

Opening with the Arabic greeting “as-salaam Alaikum”, she said the day of the attack would “now be forever a day etched in our collective memories”.

“He sought many things from his act of terror but one was notoriety, that is why you will never hear me mention his name,” she said of the gunman. “He is a terrorist. He is a criminal. He is an extremist. But he will, when I speak, be nameless.

“And to others, I implore you: speak the names of those who were lost rather than the name of the man who took them. He may have sought notoriety but we, in New Zealand, will give nothing – not even his name.”

Fifty people were killed in the attack, and nine more remain in a critical condition in Christchurch hospital.

Earlier, Ardern told reporters outside a caucus meeting in Wellington she was concerned the gunman’s decision to dismiss his lawyer and represent himself in court meant he would attempt to use the trial to spread his political views.

Brenton Tarrant a 28-year-old Australian, has been charged with one count of murder and appeared briefly at the Christchurch district court on Saturday.

He was appointed a duty lawyer but dismissed him that afternoon. The Guardian understands he told the lawyer that he intended to represent himself and did not fill out a form requesting legal aid.

Asked by reporters if she was concerned he would attempt to use his trial as a platform, Ardern said she assumed that was his intention but hoped the media would deny him that kind of coverage.

The government was expected to announce changes to its gun laws before Monday, with Ardern telling reporters that cabinet had already decided on the changes and there was “a sense of urgency” and resolve that the reforms would not be derailed by the pro-gun lobby.

“We do have legitimate and responsible gun use, particularly in our rural community,” she said. “My view is that those gun owners will be with us, that is my absolute belief.”

There are already reports of farmers handing in their rifles in the wake of the attack.

The foreign minister, Winston Peters, will fly to Jakarta on Tuesday night as part of a visit to Indonesia and Turkey to convey New Zealand’s deepest sympathies to those countries. He told the New Zealand Herald that many of those killed or injured in the attack were either from, or had family in, Indonesia.

Meanwhile, Ardern is to return to Christchurch on Wednesday, when the burials for the 50 people killed in the worst terrorist attack in New Zealand’s modern history are expected to begin.

Armed police patrolled Memorial Park cemetery on Tuesday, while gravediggers could be seen preparing the ground.

The cemetery is 2km from Linwood mosque, where seven people were shot dead. At Al Noor mosque, where most of the 50 victims were killed, police were collecting flowers left by the public and pinning them on the fence. Paper chains left by school students read “we are one people” and “I am sorry we could not keep you safe”.

In her parliamentary statement, Ardern highlighted the bravery of two men inside Al Noor mosque: Naim Rasheed, who died trying to wrestle the gun from the shooter; and Abdul Aziz, who threw a card payment machine at the gunman to chase him away “and no doubt saved many with his bravery”. Both men were originally from Pakistan.

She also mentioned Haji-Daoud Nabi, 71, who was shot dead after opening the doors of the mosque and saying: “Hello, brother”.

“He had no idea of the hate that sat behind that door,” Ardern said. “But his welcome tells us so much – that he was a member of a faith that welcomed all its members, that showed openness and care.”

Ardern said the right to safety included the right to be “free from the fear of those sentiments of racism and hate that create a place where violence can flourish”, and that racism did exist in New Zealand.

The government has established an independent inquiry into how its intelligence and security agencies failed to prevent the attack, including whether they failed to appropriately heed warnings from the Muslim community about an escalation in threats of violence.

However, the justice minister, Andrew Little, rejected criticism of the intelligence agencies GCSB and SIS, telling TVNZ1 they had followed up “each tipoff they got that related to extremism of whatever form”. The GCSB confirmed late on Monday it had not received any relevant information or intelligence before last week’s shooting.

Ardern said she had spoken to her British counterpart, Theresa May, about taking global action against the failure of Facebook to prevent the attack being livestreamed. On Monday, Facebook told authorities it had deleted 1.5m copies of the video but it still remained in circulation.

Ardern said social media companies “are the publisher, not just the postman”.

Facebook said in a statement the video was viewed fewer than 200 times during the live broadcast and no users reported the video while it was streaming.

## 7, Jacinda Ardern to appoint minister to act on Christchurch shooting report

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/07/jacinda-ardern-to-appoint-minister-to-act-on-christchurch-shooting-report

> New Zealand government due to release findings of royal commission inquiry into 2019 mosque attacks

New Zealand will appoint a new minister to implement recommendations from an extensive inquiry into the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in which 51 people died, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said.

“The [Muslim] community will want to see accountability in terms of the implementation, they will want to know who is responsible for coordinating some of those efforts and we will be providing that,” she told reporters after a cabinet meeting on Monday.

The prime minister, who visited survivors and the families of those killed in the South Island city on the weekend, said the government would provide a “very initial response” to the findings after the report’s release on Tuesday.

Because of the breadth of the recommendations it would take time to implement some while others could be moved on quite quickly, Ardern said.

The families have already received an advance copy of the 792-page inquiry report.

The announcement came as the Islamic Women’s Council New Zealand (IWCNZ) called on the government to make a formal national apology.

“The nation needs an apology ... and that apology should not just come from police, but rather the entire government,” said its spokeswoman, Aliya Danzeisen.

“An apology is the first step to healing and repairing the damage that was caused. Saying sorry is expressing true sorrow for the loss and damage. It would be a good start.”

In her comments on Monday, Ardern refused to say whether her government would apologise, saying that any response would be given after the report’s release. “That will enable us to give a bit of context,” she said.

The government instigated a royal commission of inquiry into the country’s security agencies in the wake of the 15 March, 2019 shootings, the deadliest in modern New Zealand history and the worst ever committed by an Australian national.

Prior to the attack the gunman, Brenton Tarrant, posted multiple references to his plan online, was able to legally obtain a gun licence, and carried out reconnaissance missions at both mosques. When he was sentenced in August to life imprisonment without parole, it was revealed how he had meticulously planned the two mosque shootings, as well as more attacks.

The 20-month inquiry took place behind closed doors and involved interviews with everyone from top security officials to survivors and current and former prime ministers.

Submissions by the Islamic community outlined attempts to alert authorities over the previous months and years to what they saw as a rising threat from far-right extremists. This included a threat made by a separate individual to burn a Koran outside a mosque on the day of the terror attack.

“Not a single police officer or investigator came to question or follow up regarding [that] threat,” Aliya Danzeisen, a spokeswoman for the IWCNZ, told AAP.

Writing in the Guardian last month, Danzeisen, who has led government engagement for the IWCNZ, said New Zealand Muslims had put their faith in the inquiry to help heal and protect the nation.

“We also hope the report includes clear ideas on how the government can address the rising hate and ‘othering’, and offers suggestions on how to maintain and further promote that togetherness that the nation showed immediately after the attack,” she wrote.

In the aftermath of the atrocity, New Zealand passed laws to ban semi-automatic weapons and introduce a gun buyback scheme. Further legislation to set up a national firearms register and new licensing requirements has stalled.

This year the gunman pleaded guilty to all 92 charges – one of engaging in a terrorist act, 51 of murder, and 40 of attempted murder – and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

## 8, Christchurch shooting: Ardern says 'manifesto' sent to office minutes before massacre

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/17/christchurch-attack-death-toll-rises-to-50-as-concern-grows-over-burial-delays

> New Zealand prime minister says document did not contain location or details on the shootings

The alleged Christchurch mosque shooter sent a “manifesto” to the office of New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern minutes before the terrorist attack that left 50 people dead, she has said.

Her office was among more than 30 New Zealand parliamentary email addresses that received the document on Friday.

The document did not include a location or specific details about the attack.

“I was one of more than 30 recipients of the manifesto that was mailed out nine minutes before the attack took place. It did not include a location, it did not include specific details,” she said. “I am advised that within two minutes of its receipt, at least my office it was conveyed directly to parliamentary security.”

Ardern said that if the document had “provided details that could have been acted upon immediately it would have been”.

“Unfortunately, there were no such details in that email,” she said.

She said she had read “elements” of the document, which was also sent to media outlets and the parliamentary tourism office in the minutes before the attack.

“Again, the fact that there was an ideological manifesto with extreme views attached to this attack, of course that is deeply disturbing,” she said.

Ardern said she was receiving advice as to whether the man accused of killing 50 people in the attack could be deported after his trial. Brenton Tarrant, who is an Australian citizen, was charged with one count of murder in relation to the attacks on Saturday.

“I don’t want to preempt anything,” she said. “He will certainly face the justice system of New Zealand.”

Ardern said there were “questions to be answered” about the role social media played in disseminating video of the attack and confirmed she had been contacted by Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer in the wake of the shootings.

“This is a problem that goes well beyond New Zealand. It has played out in other parts of the world. So while we might have seen action taken here, that has not dented them being circulated beyond New Zealand’s shores,” Ardern said.

Earlier in the day Ardern went to Kilbirnie mosque in Wellington to lay flowers. She said the Accident Compensation Corporation would provide families with a funeral grant of around $10,000.

The death toll from the mosque terror attacks in Christchurch had risen to 50, New Zealand’s police commissioner confirmed earlier in the day.

Bush also addressed concerns that police took too long to respond to the massacre, saying officers were at the scene within six minutes of the first emergency call, and disarmed offenders within 10 minutes.

Police apprehended the killer within 36 minutes, Bush said.

He added all victims had been removed from the scenes of the massacres at the Al Noor and Linwood mosques.

Thirty-four of the injured remain in Christchurch hospital, where they are being treated with the utmost care and professionalism by medical staff. Twelve people were critical, and one child was also in hospital in Christchurch. A four-year-old girl remained in a critical condition in Auckland.

Tarrant remains the only person charged in relation to the attacks, Bush said, and he would likely face more charges. A woman apprehended at the scene was released without charge. Another 18 year-old man arrested in a vehicle had been charged with firearm offences unrelated to the terrorist attack.

Bush acknowledged the frustration being felt by family members of the victims, who were desperate to bury their loved ones. While interpretation of Islamic law regarding burials varies, burying a person as soon as possible after death is a fundamental principal of Islam, usually no more than 24 hours later.

Bush said forensic officers and pathologists had been working around the clock to gather the evidence from the bodies needed.

“What we have to do is determine the cause of death,” Bush said. “We have been working with pathologists and working with coroners and the chief coroner to complete that process. We have to be absolutely clear on cause of death and confirm their identity before that can happen. But we are so aware of the cultural and religious needs. So we are doing that as quickly and sensitively as possible.”

On Sunday afternoon, Ardern said a small number of bodies would be released to families by Sunday night.

Bush paid tribute to police officers who responded to the scene and who had the grim task of assisting the wounded and detaining the gunman.

“Our staff acted with absolute courage in intervening and had to use some force and deploy tactical options to make that happen. That put themselves in harm’s way to stop further attack. I do believe they did prevent further attacks.”

Bush said New Zealanders should return to their normal lives and routines on Monday, but would see a visible and heightened police presence in Christchurch “on the streets, around your businesses, around your schools, and even in the air, right across the country. So you will feel safe to go about what you want to do tomorrow.”

## 9, Christchurch mosque attacks: burials begin as Ardern urges students to reject hate

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/20/christchurch-mosque-attacks-burials-begin-as-ardern-urges-students-to-reject-hate

> New Zealand prime minister returns to city where 50 were killed as foreign minister heads to Turkey

Burials for the 50 people killed the New Zealand terrorist attack have begun in Christchurch as the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, returned to the city to pay her respects and comfort those affected by the killings.

On Wednesday, father and son Khaled and Hamza Mustafa, who arrived in New Zealand as refugees from Syria, were the first victims to be buried. The prime minister told reporters: “I cannot tell you how gutting it is to know that a family came here for safety and for refuge, and they should have been safe here.”

Earlier, police said they planned to release most of the bodies back to their families by Wednesday night, with Ardern promising to work with authorities to see if the coronial process could be sped up in future to comply with Islamic burial rites.

Police commissioner Mike Bush said the process had to be “done properly” to prevent jeopardising future prosecutions. “We must prove for prosecution the cause of death to the satisfaction of the judge,” he said. “You cannot convict for murder without proving that cause of death ... to get it wrong is unforgivable and you cannot come back from that.”

Ardern also visited old students at Cashmere high school, which is dealing with the loss of two students, and implored the children to join her in rejecting messages of racism and hate.

“This is my request, I alone cannot get rid of those things, I need help from every single one of us,” she said. “So yes, gather together, show those outpourings of love, but also let New Zealand be a place where there is no tolerance for racism ever. That’s something we can all do.”

The crowd of 400 students performed a haka and took the opportunity to question Ardern over the attack. One student asked the prime minister how she was feeling, to which Ardern replied: “I am very sad.”

As she promised on Tuesday, Ardern did not say the attacker’s name, and at one point was spontaneously hugged by one of the pupils.

Asked if she would welcome a visit by Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to New Zealand after she criticised social media for its role in spreading footage of the attack, she said “I’m not interested in a PR exercise.”

Ardern also said foreign minister Winston Peters would travel to Turkey to “confront” comments made by Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan in the wake of the shooting.

Erdoğan - who is seeking to drum up support for his Islamist-rooted AK Party in 31 March local elections - said Turkey would make the suspected attacker pay if New Zealand did not.

He also suggested that anyone who comes to Turkey with anti-Muslim sentiments would be sent back in coffins, “like their grandfathers were” during the Gallipoli campaign.

The comments came at a campaign rally that included video footage of the shootings which the alleged gunman had broadcast on Facebook.

Ardern said Peters would seek urgent clarification.

“Our deputy prime minister will be confronting those comments in Turkey,” she said. “He is going there to set the record straight, face-to-face.”

The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, called in the Turkish ambassador to Canberra over the comments made by Erdoğan.

Elsewhere, Ardern said access to military-style semi-automatic weapons would be the focus of new gun control laws, adding: “We have a large number of loopholes in our laws.”

She said Australia took 12 days to change its gun laws following the 1996 Port Arthur massacre and “we will do it in less”. The country’s peak hunting body, Fish and Game NZ, said it would support a ban and buyback of military-style semi-automatic weapons and restrictions on high-capacity magazines.

It was an emotional day in Christchurch, where 29 people are still in hospital after the attacks. Speaking at a press conference one surgeon, who operated on a critically injured four-year-old girl, said he imagined she was one of his children.

Dr Adib Khanafer, a vascular surgeon at Christchurch hospital, said he was called out of another surgery on Friday afternoon to operate on the young girl. “I have four kids,” he said. “The youngest is seven, the oldest is 14, and I just imagine this was one of my kids. I was able to do my job and I left my emotions until after … after I had repaired her.

“I am from England. I am a Muslim. And I am Arab. And all my colleagues, Kiwis, have not stopped emailing me, texting me, and sending me flowers.”

The alleged gunman, who is an Australian, has been charged with one count of murder. Bush said he expected a “considerable number of the most serious charges” would be added to the prosecution before his next court appearance.

A multinational investigation team comprised of officers from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Australian Federal Police and New South Wales police has assembled in Wellington to trace the background of the suspect, Brenton Tarrant.

Bush said intelligence agencies from other Five Eyes countries were also helping to “build a comprehensive picture of this person that we will put before the court”.

“What I can say at the moment most positively is there was only one attacker,” he said. “The investigation focus is to work out if anyone else was involved in supporting or in any other away and we are still conducting that part of the investigation.”

An independent investigation has also been ordered into New Zealand’s intelligence agencies, following reports that it received tip-offs from the Muslim community and a gun seller about an apparent increase in white supremacist activities.

## 10, Move to make Christchurch massacre film all about Jacinda Ardern sparks anger

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/11/film-about-jacinda-arderns-response-to-christchurch-massacre-triggers-anger-new-zealand

> Critics say focus on the prime minister glosses over the experience of the Muslims still struggling with aftermath of mosque shootings

Plans for a Hollywood film focusing on prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s response to the Christchurch mosque terror attacks have prompted frustration and disgust in New Zealand, with accusations that Muslim victims have been sidelined.

The film is set to star Australian actor Rose Byrne as Ardern, according to the Hollywood Reporter, and is called They Are Us – a line derived from one of Ardern’s speeches at the time. It is to be directed by New Zealand film-maker Andrew Niccol, and produced by FilmNation.

On Friday, some New Zealanders criticised the decision to tell the story of Ardern’s leadership against the backdrop of the mass murder of 51 Muslims by a white supremacist as “exploitative”, “insensitive”, and “obscene”.

Ardern has distanced herself from the movie, and issued a statement via a spokesperson saying “the prime minister and the government have no involvement in the film”.

Writer and community advocate Guled Mire said the film’s premise was “completely insensitive”. He said that while the film-makers may have consulted with some members of the Muslim community, many had no idea the news was coming. “It’s hit all of us out of the blue,” he said. “Many victims themselves haven’t even heard of this.”

He said the film’s apparent focus on Ardern glossed over the experience of Muslims who survived the attack. “The reality is many victims are struggling right now. They’re really still trying to pick up the pieces – financially, everything,” he said. “This tapped into that vulnerability to make the most out of the situation.”

Many of those injured and bereaved by the attacks face ongoing financial stress, lifelong physical issues and mental trauma, and have called for a better response from government.

Mire said: “Nobody wants to see the fact that victims themselves and their families and witnesses are not able to receive the mental health support that they rightfully deserve. Nobody wants to talk about the lack of financial compensation for the government’s failings. Not a single official has been held responsible for this.”

The Guardian has approached production company FilmNation Entertainment and Niccol’s agency for comment.

Hollywood Reporter said the film “will tell the story of how Ardern rallied New Zealand following the terror attacks on two mosques in 2019 with a message of compassion and unity, and helped push through a ban of assault rifles”. They also report that the script was “developed in consultation with several members of the mosques affected”.

New Zealand writer Mohamed Hassan criticised those behind the film for turning the attacks into a “white saviour narrative”. He added: “The pain is still fresh and real. This is upsetting, obscene and grotesque.”

Aya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein was murdered in the attack, said it was insensitive, tweeting the classic Kiwi-ism “Yeah nah”. “I don’t think this film will be received well in New Zealand. My guess is it’s Hollywood over-capitalising this,” she told Australian Associated Press.

Others voiced their anger on Twitter. Local producer Ahmed Osman said many survivors and families of the victims were still “living through [a] nightmare” and had not received sufficient support. The film amounted to “the glorification of the most tragic and traumatic thing that’s ever happened to them,” he said. “While we are at it, why don’t we make [a] film about the failings of the police and the SIS [Security Intelligence Service]. The monitoring of innocent Muslim and our community, the consistent harassment and racial profiling we go through.”

The slaughter of 51 Muslim New Zealanders is NOT the backdrop to a fkg film about white woman strength. COME ON.

The film’s planned title, They Are Us, is drawn from a quote by Ardern in the immediate aftermath of the attacks: “They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home. They are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not. They have no place in New Zealand.”

“They Are Us is not so much about the attack but the response to the attack … how an unprecedented act of hate was overcome by an outpouring of love and support,” Niccol told the Hollywood reporter. “The film addresses our common humanity,” he said.

The Ardern quote became a widespread motto of solidarity after the attacks. But the line itself has been criticised for “othering” New Zealand’s Muslim community and whitewashing the country’s ongoing problems with racism.

## 12, New Zealand shooting: Jacinda Ardern announces royal commission into attack

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/25/new-zealand-shooting-jacinda-ardern-announces-royal-commission-into-attack

> Prime minister says the country’s highest form of investigation is appropriate for ‘matters of the gravest public importance’

New Zealand’s prime minister has announced a top-level inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the massacre of 50 people in two Christchurch mosques.

Jacinda Ardern said the country’s highest form of investigation, a royal commission of inquiry, was appropriate for “matters of the gravest public importance”.

“It is important that no stone is left unturned to get to the bottom of how this act of terrorism occurred and what, if any, opportunities we had to stop it,” Ardern told reporters at Parliament House in Wellington on Monday.

Her cabinet had previously agreed on holding an inquiry, but had not decided what kind of investigation would be held.

A royal commission is run independently from the government and is chaired by a high court judge. It has the power to compel witnesses to testify and organisations to hand over documents. But it remains up to the courts or government to follow through on any recommendations or findings.

Ardern said the cabinet agreed on Monday a royal commission of inquiry “will look at what could have or should have been done to prevent the attack”.

An Australian, Brenton Tarrant, has been charged with murder in relation to the 15 March attacks.

The royal commission will look at his travel to and from New Zealand, internationally, his activities in New Zealand, his use of social media and his connection to others.

The agencies taking part in the inquiry would include the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, the Government Communications Security Bureau, police along with Customs and Immigration.

Ardern said that the royal commission’s terms of reference would be finalised in the next two or three weeks.

Fifty people died in the shootings at Al Noor and Linwood mosques in Christchurch, in what is New Zealand’s worst ever terrorist attack.

The county’s intelligence agencies have been under pressure for the past two weeks after they were accused of not placing enough importance on monitoring rightwing extremists.

The opposition leader, Simon Bridges, had also called for a royal commission to look at the country’s security legislation and ensure “New Zealanders are kept safe”.

Ardern said she and other ministers would soon meet with Microsoft to discuss the role of social media following the sharing of live-streamed video of the alleged gunman’s attack.

The commission follows the chief censor making it illegal to possess and share both the live-streamed video of the shooting and a document the gunman shared on social media before the attack took place.

David Shanks officially classed the so-called manifesto as “objectionable” and told anyone in possession of it to destroy it.

## 14, Christchurch attack: New Zealand tries new tactic to disrupt online extremism

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/christchurch-attack-new-zealand-tries-new-tactic-to-disrupt-online-extremism

> Jacinda Ardern says government will double its investigative operation and track down content in a similar manner to child abuse material

The New Zealand government will create a dedicated investigative team to find and prosecute terrorist and extremist content online, seven months after a gunman live-streamed the mass murder of 51 worshippers at two Christchurch mosques.

Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said NZ$17m would be spent over four years to employ 17 new full-time staff, allowing the department of internal affairs to double its investigative, forensic, intelligence and prevention work in partnership with other countries.

“We will have a dedicated team focused on targeting and disrupting violent extremist content across our digital channels. This will work in a similar way to how we target child sexual exploitation material by working with online content hosts to find and remove harmful content,” Ardern said.

The package is the main domestic component of Ardern’s Christchurch Call – a global voluntary pledge to eliminate terrorist and violent content online devised in the wake of the attack.

The country’s worst ever mass shooting was livestreamed on Facebook, and the video was shared on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook-owned apps Whatsapp and Instagram.

Ardern said the online world must be a force for good where users can “exchange ideas, share technology, and maintain civil liberties” but “we need to meet that challenge as a country and as a global community,”.

Minister of internal affairs Tracey Martin said the “ease and speed” with which the video of the 15 March massacre spread online showed the government needed better systems in place to protect New Zealanders online.

Some of the funding would also be directed to the office of the chief censor to enable his team to assess and make faster decisions about harmful content.

In the long-term, the government would also strengthen the current laws to ensure it responds more swiftly, and explore how online providers should be regulated.

Last week Ardern said the Christchurch Call was already having an impact, citing the contained spread of the recent German shooting livestream video.

More than 50 companies and countries have signed the Christchurch Call, including Amazon, Google, Facebook and Twitter.

The pledge does not contain any enforcement or regulatory measures, and it is up to each individual country and company to decide how it would honour its voluntary commitments.

## 15,  I survived the Christchurch terror attack – the government is in danger of forgetting us

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/15/christchurch-terror-attack-survivor-comment

> Five years on from the massacre, the government is preparing to roll back gun reforms and progress to make New Zealand safer is faltering

The day before the fifth anniversary of a terrorist attack at my mosque, New Zealand’s prime minister Christopher Luxon sent an email to the bereaved and survivors of the massacre in Christchurch, including me. Fifty-one Muslims were killed at Masjid al-Noor and at Linwood Islamic Centre during Friday prayers on 15 March 2019, and 40 were injured. In his note on Thursday, Luxon praised our strength, courage, compassion and dignity.

“The government is committed to keeping New Zealanders safe and secure,” he wrote. “We will ensure that lessons learned from these attacks continue to inform how we keep New Zealand safe.”

These words make me angry. Their inconsistency is confusing. Even as he says these things, the prime minister and his government are preparing to roll back some of the gun law reforms made in the aftermath of the mass shooting, which was committed by a white supremacist who acquired his weapons legally. The government has not ruled out making semiautomatic weapons more widely available. 

Today I will go to Friday prayers at the mosque and it will be as though 15 March 2019 is happening again. When I see people praying, I see the dead and injured; I remember fearing for my life. I see the bullets and the smoke.

On that day five years ago, I was shot nine times with a semiautomatic gun. I would like the prime minister to put himself in my shoes, to imagine this happening to him or his wife. Maybe he thinks it is in the past now and he doesn’t have to be stuck with our suffering any more.

I know that politicians only propose law changes if they think the public will support them. It feels like something has gone wrong in this country if that is true after only five years. Since the attacks, New Zealand has been too nervous to have some difficult conversations that could help to increase awareness of the problems we face and how to solve them. There should be public forums to talk about online extremism and racism in the street, how it happens and how to prevent it. We need to talk more.

There are still questions remaining about what happened that day. Even some of the conclusions reached by the official inquiry – that the terrorist was a lone wolf and didn’t tell anyone what he planned to do – have been cast into doubt by new research this year that found online postings he made which had never come to light before. That needs more investigation.

There is also much to do if we want to prevent such an atrocity from happening again. When she was prime minister, Jacinda Ardern understood our pain and she was honest with us, but I was disappointed in her Labour government too. They dragged their feet. In four and a half years before they were voted out, they didn’t strengthen laws against hate speech or regulate social media. They didn’t resolve the matter of reparations for those affected.

The royal commission of inquiry into the attacks made 44 recommendations and the government said it had started work on or had completed all of them. But I struggle to name one change that makes me feel safer since the attack, apart from the gun law reforms. The same issues carry on and on; no one accepts accountability. It feels like our leaders don’t care about us any more. I think they try to make us frustrated and tired so we give up.

Every three months, I must seek a fresh medical certificate to prove I am still unable to work due to PTSD so that I qualify for income support under New Zealand’s accident compensation scheme. It is like they believe that in three months I might be OK and ready to go back to work. I am a strong person but this will be with me all my life.

For a long time, I remembered holding someone’s hand under a pile of bodies as the attack went on. I could not see the man whose hand I was squeezing and didn’t know if he had lived or died. That was difficult. A few months ago, four and a half years after the attack, I finally learned his identity. The man whose hand I was holding was shot and survived, like me. All these years he had wondered who I was too. When I met him, we said to each other, “It was you. You were holding my hand.”

I want people to know that they cannot expect us to be normal again. We are still very tender about it. We are still very raw. This is different to other pain – to the end of a relationship or physical hurt. I still can’t handle what I witnessed. It will never go away.

Five years from now, I hope I don’t have to worry about being safe. I never used to feel unsafe in New Zealand before; now I don’t leave the house unless I have to. But I keep going. When I play walking football, when I see my football friends, the noise in my brain stops and for an hour I don’t feel fear any more.

I believe the reason I survived is because Allah has things left for me to do on this earth. And I do still believe in this country. We can confront our prejudices and change; understand each other better. In a recent list, New Zealand was ranked the fourth safest country in the world. I think we should aspire to be the safest.

## 16, Christchurch shooting: gunman intended to continue attack, says PM

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/16/new-zealand-massacre-shooter-intended-to-continue-attack-says-pm

> Jacinda Ardern poised to ban semi-automatic weapons as she praises police who arrested terror suspect

New Zealand will ban semi-automatic weapons after the worst mass killing in the nation’s history left 50 people dead and another 50 injured.

As the nation reeled following the terror attack on two mosques in the South Island city of Christchurch, New Zealand attorney general David Parker said the weapons would be outlawed.

Speaking on Saturday in Christchurch, New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said the suspect charged over the killings intended to “continue with his attack” when he was intercepted by police.

She said the man was arrested by two “rural community cops” 36 minutes after the first emergency call was made on Friday and was still an active shooter.

“There were two other firearms in the vehicle that the offender was in and it absolutely was his intention to continue with his attack,” she told reporters in Christchurch on Saturday.

Ardern said children were caught up in the attack and one of the injured was a two-year-old boy.

An Australian national, Brenton Tarrant, 28, appeared in court on Saturday charged with one count of murder in relation to the massacre and has been remanded in custody until 5 April. He is expected to face more charges.

Ardern said the investigation was ongoing but authorities believed there was only “one primary perpetrator”.

One other man was arrested on Friday for carrying a firearm in his car in order to get to his family home while the city was in lockdown, and was released by police without charge.

Police also arrested a couple at a roadblock. New Zealand’s police commissioner, Mike Bush, said they were “working through” whether one or both of them had any involvement in this incident.

Thirty nine people remain in hospital, 11 of whom are in critical condition in an intensive care unit. A four-year-old child in a critical condition was flown to the children’s Starship hospital in Auckland.

Christchurch hospital’s chief of surgery, Dr Greg Robertson, said many of the victims would require multiple surgeries.

Ardern met the families of victims on Saturday. She said authorities were working to ensure that bodies could be identified and repatriated quickly to allow for proper Muslim burials.

Ardern also said it was believed the weapons used in the attack had been modified and that loopholes that allow such modifications would be closed in proposed gun reforms to be discussed by cabinet on Monday.

Full details of the weapons used in the attack have not been released publicly but Ardern confirmed that two semi-automatic rifles were involved. These can be legally purchased under an entry-level “category A” firearms licence provided they do not have a high capacity magazine. Tarrant had held such a licence since December 2017.

Gun control experts told the Guardian such weapons can be easily converted into a military-style semi-automatic rifle using a high-capacity magazine, the sale of which is not regulated in New Zealand.

Authorities in both Australia and New Zealand have been asked to review why the suspect was not listed on any counter-terrorism watchlist, despite reportedly planning the attack for several years.

He identified himself as a member of online far-right extremist networks and the massacre was live-streamed on social media.

Police in Tarrant’s home state of New South Wales said they had spoken to his family, who called police after seeing the attacks reported on the news. Police are investigating whether Tarrant had any terrorist links in his hometown of Grafton or its surrounding areas.

Meanwhile, Australia’s immigration minister, David Coleman, revoked the visa of the far-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos for making comments on social media about the Christchurch attack that Coleman said were “appalling and foment hatred and division”.

Coleman personally approved the visa for Yiannopoulos’ speaking tour last week, against advice from the Department of Home Affairs.

Senior Australian politicians, including the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and opposition leader Bill Shorten, also condemned the Queensland senator Fraser Anning for saying, hours after the attack: “Does anyone still dispute the link between Muslim immigration and violence?”

Morrison said he “absolutely and completely denounced” all of Anning’s comments as “appalling and ugly” and that the government and opposition would make a joint motion censuring Anning when parliament returned in April.

## 17, Christchurch attacks: royal commission hands in report on New Zealand mosque shootings

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/26/christchurch-attacks-royal-commission-hands-in-report-on-new-zealand-mosque-shootings

> Prime minister Jacinda Ardern will decide if the nearly 800-page report will be released publicly

The royal commission’s report into the Christchurch mosque shootings 2019 has been presented to the government, 20 months after it was first commissioned.

On 15 March last year a lone gunman shot and killed 51 worshippers at two inner-city Christchurch mosques. In August the man, Australian Brenton Tarrant, was sentenced to life in prison for his crimes, which were motivated by white supremacist ideology.

The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, ordered a royal commission of inquiry into why and how the massacre took place, and whether there was anything government and police officials could have done to prevent it.

Prior to the attack the gunman posted multiple references to his plan online, was able to legally obtain a gun licence, and carried out reconnaissance missions to both mosques.

The inquiry took place behind closed doors and interviewed everyone from top security officials to survivors, current and former prime ministers.

The 792-page report was today presented to governor general, Dame Patsy Reddy, who will hand it over to the government to review.

It is up to the prime minister to decide when and how the report will be publicly released, but many are hoping for it to be made public before Christmas.

In a statement, the royal commission said it had written the report in a way that it could be made available for the public to read in full, without the need for redactions.

“Having completed 18 months of intense inquiry, engagement and analysis, we urge the government to consider the findings and act on the recommendations,” said Commissioner Sir William Young.

The minister for internal affairs, Jan Tinetti, said she had received the report and it must be presented to the House of Representatives as soon as practicable.

“We will share the report confidentially with families and victims ahead of the public release and work closely with them. It is only right that they have the space and opportunity to privately reflect on the findings,” Tinetti said.

During the course of the inquiry, more than 400 meetings were held, 340 non-disclosure orders were made, 73,500 pages of evidence and submissions were analysed and 217 public sector agencies were asked to provide information.

More than 1100 people wrote formal submissions to the commission, while many more got in touch to share their thoughts, experiences, and suggestions.

Survivors of the massacre, the worst in modern New Zealand history, say they are hopeful the government will listen to the commission’s recommendations, as some in the Muslim community feel they were ignored in the lead-up to the massacre, after warning police and authorities repeatedly that hate crimes and abusive behaviour against their community was escalating.

“It has been an honour and privilege to undertake this inquiry,” said commissioners Young and Jacqui Caine.

“Our hope is that this report not only provides answers but also impetus for change and conversations about the kind of country we want to be.”

## 18, Jacinda Ardern to tackle online extremism in new role as special envoy for Christchurch Call

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/04/jacinda-ardern-to-tackle-online-extremism-in-new-role-as-special-envoy-for-christchurch-call

> Former New Zealand prime minister will push initiative she created in wake of 2019 terrorist attack

Former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern will take on a new role working alongside international governments and social media companies to target extremism and terrorist content online.

Prime minister Chris Hipkins announced on Tuesday evening that he had appointed Ardern as special envoy for the Christchurch Call, a newly created position.

The Christchurch Call was created by Ardern in the wake of the 15 March 2019 mosque shootings, in which a white supremacist killed 51 people during an attack on two mosques in Christchurch.

The attack was livestreamed and broadcast on a number of social media platforms, and in the months that followed, Ardern created the initiative to push companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter to put in place stronger protections against the spread of extremist violent content.

“I … still feel a duty at a personal level to the community who are affected by this tragedy,” Ardern said in an interview on Tuesday evening, her first since her resignation in January. “I knew that I would have the time to do it. And I certainly have the passion for it,” she said.

“The March 15 terror attacks on Christchurch masjidain were a defining moment for our country and Jacinda Ardern’s leadership and the Christchurch Call is part of our response to those attacks,” Hipkins said.

“Jacinda Ardern’s commitment to stopping violent extremist content like we saw that day is key to why she should carry on this work. Her relationships with leaders and technology companies and her drive for change will help increase the pace and ambition of the work we are doing,” he said.

The Christchurch Call project calls on signatory nations to adopt and enforce laws that ban objectionable material, and set guidelines on how traditional media can report acts of terrorism without amplifying them.

In her first substantial media appearances since stepping down as prime minister, Ardern said that she believed her resignation could lower the temperature in New Zealand’s political discourse after deep divisions emerged around vaccination, the country’s Covid response, and her as a figure.

“It did occur to me that my departure might just take a bit of heat out,” Ardern said in one of two Tuesday night television appearances.

“If it did, that would be good for New Zealand,” she said. “I knew I was a flashpoint for some people, and again [while] that wasn’t the basis of my decision, I hoped it would be a consequence of my decision.”

“When I’ve watched on, I’ve felt like, yeah, I feel like I was right.”

Particularly in the final year of her tenure, Ardern became a lightning rod for anti-government, anti-vaccination and far right groups, with a number of men prosecuted for making threats against her and her family.

Asked whether her leaving had benefited her party, Ardern said. “I didn’t think about it as a party political person, I thought about whether or not that would just be good for New Zealand as a whole – I do think that taking a pause, taking a breath, reminding each other that we’re all just humans. If my departure has given people a bit of time to step back from some of those extreme emotions, that’s not a bad thing.”

Overall, Ardern said, her positive interactions with New Zealanders far outweighed the negative. “Of course I experience people’s thoughts and feelings face to face, and I could see there were people on both ends of the extreme … some I absolutely am aware, felt very strongly in a negative way about me and my leadership,” she said, whereas others were highly positive, sending cards, letters, and cups of tea.

Ardern also announced she would be joining the board of trustees of Prince William’s Earthshot Prize, which awards five £1m prizes each year for work providing solutions to major environmental problems.

Ardern said she “believed Earthshot’s power to encourage and spread not only the innovation we desperately need, but also optimism”.

Prince William said that Ardern would “bring a rich infusion of new thinking to our mission”.

“Four years ago, before The Earthshot Prize even had a name, Jacinda was one of the first people I spoke to, and her encouragement and advice was crucial,” he said.

With her time as member of New Zealand’s parliament coming to an end this week, the former prime minister’s exit has been a quiet one: refusing all interviews since her resignation. Ardern was due to make a television appearance – her first since her shock resignation in January – later on Tuesday, and will make her valedictory speech to the House on Wednesday.

The newly created special position will “represent New Zealand’s continued commitment to push for greater protection online from terrorist and violent extremist content,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement. In the new position, Ardern will report directly to the prime minister, and will work closely with France as co-leaders. She will begin her duties later this month, on 17 April. She will not accept remuneration for the role.

## 19, Ardern: New Zealand has 'fundamentally changed' since Christchurch shootings

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/ardern-new-zealand-has-fundamentally-changed-since-christchurch-shootings

> New Zealand PM says people have become more engaged with the Muslim community 

Jacinda Ardern says New Zealanders have become more engaged with the Muslim community in the year since a gunman killed 51 people at two mosques.

The prime minister is in Christchurch attending events to mark the anniversary of last year’s massacre on 15 March, which she has described as one of New Zealand’s darkest days. On Friday she was attending a special joint prayer with members of both mosques that were attacked and on Sunday she will attend a national memorial.

“A year on, I believe New Zealand and its people have fundamentally changed. I can’t see how you could have an event like this and not,” Ardern said. “But the challenge for us will be ensuring that in our everyday actions – and in every opportunity where we see bullying, harassment, racism, discrimination – calling it out as a nation.”

Some questioned why the memorial event on Sunday, which would pack thousands of people into an arena, was still going ahead after Ardern and other officials chose to cancel a festival in Auckland celebrating Pacific culture due to fears over coronavirus.

Ardern said that with only five confirmed cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, there were no signs yet of a community outbreak. She said the Pasifika Festival was cancelled out of a specific concern the virus could spread to Pacific islands that don’t have the health infrastructure to cope with an outbreak.

Ardern also drew attention to laws changed in response to the attacks. The deadliest types of semi-automatic weapons are now banned, and in a nationwide buyback, gun owners turned in 56,000 of their newly outlawed weapons for cash.

Ardern also talked about her work on trying to eliminate terror attacks from being shown online. Ardern brought some nations and tech companies together to work on the issue in what she named the Christchurch Call, which she had helped start a new crisis response protocol.

“As a result of the protocol and that coordination in those events where social media platforms have been used to broadcast attacks, the circulation of those videos had been far, far diminished,” she said.

Ardern’s empathetic response after the attacks and her message of unity resonated around the world last year. Images of her wearing a hijab and embracing members of the Muslim community created a lasting impression for many.

The man accused of the attacks, 29-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant, is due to stand trial in June on charges of terrorism, murder and attempted murder.

## 20, New Zealand PM vows to toughen gun control laws after Christchurch attack

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/new-zealand-prime-minister-gun-control-jacinda-ardern

> Ardern: ‘I can tell you one thing – our gun laws will change’PM says she will consider full ban on semi-automatic weapons

New Zealand’s gun control laws will be strengthened following the massacre of 49 people in Christchurch mosques, the country’s prime minister has said.

Jacinda Ardern said at a press conference early on Saturday that she would consider banning semi-automatic firearms altogether after the alleged gunman behind the shootings obtained five guns legally.

“I can tell you one thing right now: our gun laws will change,” said Ardern. “There have been attempts to change our laws in 2005, 2012 and after an inquiry in 2017. Now is the time for change.”

Ardern said the alleged shooter was found to have used five guns that he appeared to legally own under a “category A” licence obtained in November 2017. He appeared to have begun buying guns the following month, she said.

The guns taken from the alleged perpetrator included two semi-automatic guns and two shotguns, the prime minister said. Answering questions from reporters, Ardern said all options to restrict gun violence would be considered.

New Zealand allows ownership of semi-automatic guns frequently described as “assault rifles” that are banned in countries such as Australia and the UK. Guns can be bought online and anyone aged 16 with an entry-level licence can possess them.

The prime minister said early on Saturday that she had received “messages of condolence from around the world” and international leaders including Donald Trump, the US president, who has been criticised for his hostility towards Muslims.

“He very much wished for his condolences to be passed on to New Zealand,” said Ardern. “He asked what support the US could provide. My message was sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.”

Asked how Trump responded, Ardern said: “He acknowledged that and agreed.”

Four people were arrested following the attack and one was subsequently released. Arden said that person was an armed member of the public who was trying to help police at the scene.

An Australian man in his 20s has been charged with murder and is due to appear in court on Saturday. Arden followed law enforcement in not naming him or two other suspects who were being questioned.

Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian man, identified himself online as being behind the attack.

Ardern described the main suspect as having visited New Zealand “sporadically” during international travels. “They were not a resident of Christchurch,” she said.

Investigators were said to be trying to establish whether or not the other two people arrested were involved in the attacks.

Ardern said that while New Zealand’s intelligence agencies had recently increased their monitoring of far-right extremists, the alleged gunman had not come to the attention of law enforcement and had no criminal record.

The prime minister said she had asked authorities to review the main suspect’s social media output and other evidence for any material “that should have triggered a response” from police.

A total of 41 people were killed at a mosque on Deans Avenue, Ardern said, and seven were killed at a mosque on Lynwood Avenue. One person died later in hospital.

More than 40 people injured in the shootings are being treated in hospitals, Ardern said, and two of them remain in a critical condition. One of those injured is a five-year-old girl.

New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern says her country’s swift change to gun laws after the 2019 mass shooting in Christchurch was a “pragmatic” response, where “we saw something that wasn’t right and we acted on it”.

The prime minister was speaking as her visit to the United States coincided with the mass killing of 19 children at a school in Uvalde, Texas.Ardern appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, which was filmed shortly after the Uvalde shooting. “When I watch from afar and see events such as this today, it’s not as a politician. I see them just as a mother,” an emotional Ardern said. “I’m so sorry for what has happened here.”

Colbert referred to the aftermath of the 15 March 2019 mosque shootings, where 51 people were killed by a white supremacist, saying: “Immediately thereafter the New Zealand parliament took action to remove guns from the streets.”

He asked: “Why New Zealand was able to do that, when we can’t so much as pass universal background checks … how did New Zealanders get that done?”Ardern said New Zealanders are “a very pragmatic people”.

“We saw something that wasn’t right and we acted on it, and I can only speak to that experience,” she said.

“When we saw something like that happen, everyone said never again, and so it was incumbent on us as politicians to respond to that.

“Now, we have legitimate needs for guns in our country, for things like pest control and to protect our biodiversity – but you don’t need a military-style semi-automatic to do that.”

In the wake of the 2019 shooting, New Zealand banned almost all semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles. The law change was passed near-unanimously, with a single dissenting vote. Speaking at the time, Ardern said: “I could not fathom how weapons that could cause such destruction and large-scale death could have been obtained legally in this country.”

Ardern told Colbert New Zealand’s current gun control situation was imperfect and there was still work to be done.

## 22, Christchurch Call: details emerge of Ardern's plan to tackle online extremism

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/13/christchurch-call-details-emerge-of-arderns-plan-to-tackle-online-extremism

> New Zealand PM will reportedly urge nations to enforce laws banning extremist material and set rules for reporting on terrorism

Details have emerged of a plan by New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern and French president Emmanuel Macron to eliminate terrorist and violent content online.

Ardern and Macron will meet in Paris this week on the sidelines of a meeting of digital ministers from the Group of 7 nations to discuss the plan – named the “Christchurch Call” – and urge other leaders to sign up.

The New Zealand prime minister announced the project in the wake of the Christchurch mosque attacks on 15 March. The worst mass-murder in the nation’s modern history, in which 51 people were killed, was streamed live online and shared thousands of times.

On Monday the New York Times reported that the initiative would call on signatory nations to adopt and enforce laws that ban objectionable material, and set guidelines on how traditional media can report acts of terrorism without amplifying them.

However, the pledge does not contain any enforcement or regulatory measures, and it would be up to each individual country and company to decide how it would honour its voluntary commitments.

A definition of violent extremist content was not included in a draft version of the pledge, and it would be up to individual companies to decide on what constituted objectionable material, the paper said. The pledge asked tech companies to enforce their terms of service, as well as “re-evaluate their algorithms that direct users to extremist content, and commit to redirecting people looking for extremist material”.

At the summit in Paris on Wednesday, Ardern will meet the leaders of global tech giants including Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will not attend the event.

Before leaving New Zealand, Ardern said her country of fewer than 5 million people had been “left reeling” after the Christchurch attack, and despite free speech principles being a central tenet of western democracy, no one has “a right to livestream the murder of 50 people”.

“This was a terrorist attack that was designed to go viral,” said Ardern in a video discussing the Christchurch Call.

Ardern said many people did not seek out the video of the attack, but saw it unwittingly because “the proliferation of it was so extreme”. Ardern herself saw parts of the video when it appeared on her Facebook page shortly after the attack.

It was important to New Zealanders that the internet remained “free, open and accessible”, Ardern said, and the Christchurch Call would not impinge on those rights, but seek to patrol the dissemination and spread of terrorist and extremist material online.

New Zealand government officials have already visited the White House and the state department to discuss the pledge and urge the US to sign, the Times reported, although the US has indicated it would not.

Britain, Canada, Australia, Jordan, Senegal, Indonesia, Norway and Ireland have indicated they intend to sign the pledge.

The news came as New Zealand opened a royal commission into the Christchurch attacks.

The inquiry will look into the suspected gunman’s activities, use of social media and international connections, as well as whether there was inappropriate priority settings in counter terrorism resources.

“The commission’s findings will help to ensure such an attack never happens here again,” Ardern said in a statement. Its findings will be handed to the government on 10 December.

 This article was amended on 13 May 2019 to remove an incorrect reference to Australia not supporting the “Christchurch Call”. Australia has endorsed the call, as the article now makes clear.

> New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern pledges to fight racism as she joins around 1,000 people to mark the second anniversary of the mosque attacks

The 51 worshippers murdered in the Christchurch mosque attacks almost two years ago by a white supremacist have been remembered at a national service with songs, prayers, speeches and pledges to rebuild the community.

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and the governor general, Patsy Reddy, joined around 1,000 members of the community at Christchurch’s Horncastle arena on Saturday for the service.

The centrepiece of the service was a reading of the names of the dead as their pictures were displayed on a big screen alongside descriptions provided by their families.

“Lovely and always helpful from the bottom of his heart towards others. Courageous and loyal till his last breath,” read the dedication to Hussein Al-Umari, who died attempting to confront the terrorist, Australian man Brenton Tarrant, at Al Noor mosque.

In the 15 March 2019 attacks, Tarrant killed 44 people at Al Noor mosque during Friday prayers before driving to the Linwood mosque, where he killed another seven.

The 30-year-old pleaded guilty last year to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one count of terrorism. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

On Saturday, representatives of bereaved families, affected youth, the wounded and the community gave speeches to those assembled.

Temel Atacocugu, who was shot nine times in the face, arms and legs, delivered an address on behalf of the injured, according to Stuff. He said 15 March 2019 was the day that “marked history with a dark stain”.

He said the victims were “proud Cantabrians and New Zealanders – they are us” and described how he managed to escape Al Noor mosque with a friend.

“The 200-metre walk to the ambulance was the longest, hardest path I have ever taken. I sat on the ground beside an ambulance … my body filled with pain and fear. I kept thinking of my two sons, my mother, my siblings and all the people I love.” He cried as he recalled the moment the father of three-year-old Mucaad Ibrahim was told he had died.

Maha Elmadani, whose father, Ali Mah’d Elmadani, was among the dead, said those killed were loving fathers, mothers, brothers and sons. “They had so much to give to this land, they were proud Kiwis and we were blessed to have them in our lives.”

She said living a principled life was just as important as remembering the dead: “Spread kindness. Spread kindness. That is what we have been taught.”

Amid the personal tributes, there were also pleas for more action.

Kiran Munir, who lost her husband, Haroon Mahmood, said there was an “urgent need to have well defined laws for hate crime and hate speech” as recommended by the royal commission into the attack and as promised by Ardern during last year’s election campaign.

“The gaps and flaws in the system in our society are laid bare in the royal commission report,” she said.

“There’s still a long way to go to make sure nothing like this ever happens again. Even so, the wound that gets bandaged and cared for, will heal much faster and better than the one that is not looked after. Thank you Aotearoa and the team of five million for being our bandage.”

Ardern spoke last, clad not in a hijab as she did in the days following the attack to show her support, but a korowai, a Māori cloak symbolic of leadership.

She said that as she tried to prepare words to say at the service she was “at a loss”, according to Stuff.

“Much has been said, but words, despite their healing power will never change what happened that day. Words will not bring back those men women and children who gathered at their place of worship, quietly and peacefully when they were taken in an act of terror.”

She also pledged to continue to fight racism.

“In the aftermath of the terror attack I heard the stories of women who were frequently harassed because they were easily identifiable,” she said.

“Of children whose earliest experiences of racism are in the school grounds. We have to ask ourselves, what does it take a create a generation that is emphatic but strong?”

‘Racism is not welcome here’ – Ardern’s speech in full


New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern was greeted with a standing ovation as she took the stage to address a crowd of thousands gathered at Hagley Park for a nationwide remembrance service in honour of 50 people killed in the country’s worst terrorist attack.

“The world has been stuck in a vicious cycle of extremism breeding extremism and it must end,” she said. “We cannot confront these issues alone, none of us can ... The answer lies in our humanity. But for now we will remember the tears of our nation and the new resolve we have formed.”

“We each hold the power – in our words, in our actions, in our daily acts of kindness – let that be the legacy of the 15th of March,” Ardern said.

She said to applause that New Zealanders had: “a responsibility to be the place that we wish to be. A place that is diverse, that is welcoming, that is kind and compassionate. Those values represent the very best of us. But even the ugliest of viruses can exist in places they are not welcome. Racism exists, but it is not welcome here.”

The service, known as Ko Tātou, Tātou We Are One, was broadcast live to many other events taking place around the country, to commemorate those who died two weeks ago when a gunman stormed two mosques in central Christchurch.

An estimated 20,000 people attended the event, including Australian prime minister Scott Morrison and other heads of state from the Pacific. Also in attendance were survivors of the attack and those who lost loved ones, as well as musician Yusuf Islam, formerly Cat Stevens, who performed at the event.

Farid Ahmed, who survived the Al Noor mosque attack but whose wife Husna Ahmed died, said when he is asked why he has forgiven the attacker, he says Allah loves those who “control their anger and pardon their fellow human”.

His wife’s name was among the 50 read out by members of the Muslim community during a solemn part of the service.

Farid Ahmed said he wanted to offer his prayers for the people who were killed and also the people who survived. “I would like to honour you for your presence today ... I want to thank New Zealanders for coming together; for showing the world that New Zealand is a peaceful country.”

Christchurch mayor Lianne Dalziel told the crowd they all had a responsibility to question themselves about their own views and the “comfort we give to people who might harbour racist or hateful views”, adding: “We will not be defined by what happened on the 15th of March.”

President of the Muslim Council of Canterbury, Shaggaf Khan, said he was deeply saddened by the event but humbled by the outpouring of grief that followed.

“That you did not leave us alone in our sadness. New Zealand responded in a way that none of us will ever forget – that let the world know who we really are.”

Before performing Peace Train, musician Yusuf Islam, said his heart went out to those affected and hoped the negative event would come to show the positives of the response.

“It’s only when good people stay sitting that evil rises ... we’ve seen the opposite in this country.”

The service was jointly led by the government, the City of Christchurch, local iwi Ngāi Tahu and the Muslim community.

Large swathes of the city were sealed off for the event, with police saying much planning had gone into the service and that public safety was the priority. The national threat level is still high.

At the remembrance event that was held at Auckland’s Eden Park stadium, All Black Sonny Bill Williams said he was a proud Muslim and New Zealander and commended the country for its reaction to the attack. “I just want to say to our New Zealand community, from my heart, the response has been beautiful.”

Williams, who has visited the injured in hospital, told the crowd. “Let’s keep leading the way for the world to see how it’s done.”

At a glance: what we know about the attack 


Authorities in New Zealand have not said exactly what type of firearm was used in the mosque attacks, but prime minister Jacinda Ardern did say in a press conference this afternoon that the weapons “appear to have been modified.”

The weapons she was referring two were two semi-automatic rifles, part of the arsenal of five guns that were allegedly in the possession of Australian terror suspect Brenton Tarrant.

Tarrant held a “category A” firearms licence, which is the entry level gun licence in New Zealand. It is fairly easy to obtain so long as you pass the police background check and complete a firearms safety course. There is no requirement to register category A firearms, meaning that gun owners are able to stockpile as many weapons as they like without being monitored.

The category A licence entitles the holder to purchase any of more than 2,000 types of firearm, including semi-automatic rifles. It does not entitle them to hold a military-style semi automatic rifle (MSSA) which are restricted to a “category E” and, if owned legally, must be registered and stored securely.

Ardern’s comments, together with earlier comments of police commissioner Mike Bush, suggest that Tarrant may have modified a gun that he was legally allowed to own — an ordinary semi-automatic rifle — into a MSSA using a high capacity magazine.

Bush told reporters on Saturday that a “category A” firearm holder “can purchase the firearms without the magazines or the things that will enable them to be in the state that they were.”

The sale of high-capacity magazines is unregulated in New Zealand.

According to Philip Alpers, a gun policy expert from the Sydney School of Public Health at Sydney University, using a high-capacity magazine would “make those firearms technically illegal… but would be very easy to acquire.”

Police Association President Chris Cahill welcomed the Prime Minister’s early commitment to changing New Zealand’s gun laws. “We cannot ignore the role of guns in this event,” he said.

Mr Cahill added: “Jacinda Ardern has said emphatically that New Zealand’s gun laws will change and that now is the time for that change. I absolutely agree with her and I believe many New Zealanders will be aghast that in our country someone can amass a cache of weapons like that discovered in this Christchurch tragedy.”

The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has just given a press conference. He confirmed that the main suspect “was on nobody’s radar” and that “this is the real challenge with regard to terrorism”.

He denounced comments by an Australian senator that blamed the massacre on immigration laws. Fraser Anning’s comments were “appalling” and “ugly” and have no place in Australia or the Australian parliament, he said.

Morrison said it was too early to tell whether the shooting suspect, an Australian, would be extradited, saying the process begins with New Zealand’s justice system.

He revealed his personal shock at the events in Christchurch, saying he had lived in New Zealand for some years. “This is a traumatic and tectonic event for New Zealand - it’s such a peaceful place,” he said. “I lived there for some years. For this to happen is incredibly distressing.”

He says the “intent was to inspire more hatred and violence. To provide some sort of sick leadership and what we say today is no. Peace and love will triumph.”

Quite a bit of new information there so will bring that to you shortly in a summary

She says security authorities were aware of a global rise in violent rightwing extremism but that this individual was not on any watchlist for New Zealand or Australia.

Further work will be done to ascertain if he should have been.

She says the weapons used in the attack were modified and praised the two police officers who arrested the man. They were rural community cops from Lincoln, she said. They “put New Zealand first”.

Ardern:

Jacinda Ardern is speaking now

For those separated from family in yesterday’s s attacks, this Red Cross website enables you to register a missing person and register that you are alive.

New Zealand’s attorney general, David Parker, has warned of a global rise in extremism and said the government would ban semi-automatic rifles, the New Zealand Herald has reported.

He reportedly made the remarks at a vigil in Auckland’s Aotea Square to loud cheers.

“There is a dimming of enlightenment in many parts of the world,” he is quoted as saying, asking how can it be right that the atrocity was livestreamed and broadcast by social media companies.

His comments follow an earlier promise from the prime minister that gun laws will be changed. She said the main suspect had five firearms on him, including two semi-automatic weapons.

## 27, An image of hope: how a Christchurch photographer captured the famous Ardern picture

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/25/an-image-of-hope-how-a-local-photographer-captured-the-famous-ardern-picture

> Kirk Hargreaves reveals lucky break behind a picture of the New Zealand prime minister that symbolised the nation’s grief

In the wake of the Christchurch massacre, stunned residents were looking for images of hope.

They found it in a photograph of prime minister Jacinda Ardern, clad in a black headscarf and overlaid with flowers reflected on the glass outside.

She is listening with clasped hands to the Muslim community in Christchurch, not 24 hours after 50 of their number had been gunned down by an alleged terrorist. Her face attentive, compassionate. On New Zealand’s “darkest day”, she was showing its best qualities.

The photo was taken by Christchurch city council photographer Kirk Hargreaves at the Phillipstown community centre at about midday on Saturday.

Ardern had just flown into the city along with the leaders of other political parties and a contingent of Wellington media. She went straight to the community hub to meet representatives from the Muslim community.

They gathered in a small, converted classroom. Hargreaves, formerly with Christchurch paper The Press, arrived late and could not get inside.

“That’s how I got to be outside taking that photograph,” he said. “It certainly wasn’t a good feeling to be stuck out there by myself not getting any imagery.”

Hargreaves tried to photograph the meeting through the window but the glare from the sun meant he couldn’t see through. Then Ardern stood up, and he could see her face through the glass.

“I couldn’t actually photograph her at first because there was so much reflection,” he said. “So I tried to put on a filter which is called a polarising filter … it didn’t work but I just thought ‘oh, bummer, I’ll leave it’.

“But then I found this kind of angle to photograph through … and I was then starting to get hit with her amazing body language and then all the reflections of the flowers and trees outside had done this incredible stuff … the whole thing was such a blend of different religions as well as her incredible body language and I thought: I have just got to get these pictures.”

The image was uploaded on the council’s Facebook page and has been widely shared across both social and traditional media as a defining image of Ardern’s leadership.

In a bleak period in the city’s history, Hargreaves said the image is one of hope.

“When I took it I was so moved by the humanity,” he said. “I probably didn’t know how well it was going to go, but as a photographer I knew that this was a cranking shot. It just sums up what she’s doing, how she’s offering her humanity in a way to those people and she’s listening, she’s concerned, she’s loving.”

He said the image would be interpreted in the same way in “any religion, any culture in the world”.

It is not just Ardern’s stoicism on display: also in frame is the face of James Shaw, the co-leader of the Green party, sporting a black eye from being punched by an angry voter as he walked through Wellington.

“When they came out of that room I was amazed at the way all the politicians, the leaders, they were all jamming on the same page, they were all in it together,” Hargreaves said. “It wasn’t just her … it was such an example of what people should be looking for in their leaders.”

## 28, Erdoğan praises New Zealand PM after row over mosque attacks

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/22/erdogan-praises-new-zealand-pm-row-mosque-attack-remarks

> Turkish leader softens tone after screening of Christchurch shootings footage at rallies

The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has tried to smooth over his diplomatic row with New Zealand by saying Jacinda Ardern’s empathy after the deadly mosque attacks in Christchurch was an example to the world.

Erdoğan has been accused of exploiting the attack in his local election campaign by screening video footage of the assault at his rallies, and claiming the killings were not the work of a single gunman.

At a rally in Çanakkale, Erdoğan invoked the Gallipoli campaign against Anzac troops in the first world war, saying anyone who went to Turkey for anti-Muslim reasons would be returned “in coffins” as their grandfathers had been. His spokesman said he had been quoted out of context.

New Zealand’s deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, is in Istanbul for an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation meeting and Ardern has asked him to demand an explanation from Erdoğan, and hold substantial talks. Peters said: “I certainly intend to put New Zealand’s record as being an innocent party to an act of a foreigner in our country.”

However, when asked during a question-and-answer session, Peters said he had not brought up the use of the video with Erdoğan, as he understood the president had stopped using it.

“I felt that I did not have to ask, because they are not doing that anymore,” Peters told reporters after his meeting with the Turkish president.

Peters said Erdoğan reassured him that Australian and New Zealand citizens coming to Turkey would be welcome and that the initial “misinterpretations” were all cleared up.

He also suggested that if convicted the Christchurch suspect would “spend the rest of his life in isolation in a New Zealand prison”.

In his speech to the OIC meeting, Erdoğan also tried to end the dispute by thanking the people and authorities of New Zealand for their sensitivity and determination against the attack, saying the prime minister personally had been an example to world leaders.

“I would like to thank the government, especially the prime minister, on behalf of myself, my country and my organisation for their determined stance against the event. The reaction, and the empathy on display, should be an example to all world leaders,” he said.

He added: “We must not let this brutal act of terrorism go into oblivion.”

Erdoğan criticised populist politicians who he said encouraged attacks on Muslims and refugees.

He said: “Politicians who pave themselves the road to power by alienating Muslims and creating enemies out of refugees must pull themselves together.”

Erdoğan argued Muslims were not the only ones affected by “rising cultural racism”. But he called on the world to fight Islamophobia with the same determination as antisemitism was combatted after the Holocaust.

He said the assault that led to the death of 50 people in New Zealand should be regarded not as an isolated event, but as the tip of an iceberg. “From the manifesto to the horrific images, the date, the name, the place on the weapon, many things prove this fact. The New Zealand attack is neither the first nor the last attack targeting Muslims,” he said.

“We can’t solve problems by sweeping them under the carpet. We cannot treat social diseases by ignoring them. We can’t get away from problems by hiding. We cannot respond to the issues that threaten us and all humanity with silence.”

He said too often those who mounted such assaults claimed they were simply an individual criminal or psychologically distressed. He added: “By punishing this terrorist as he deserves, by revealing all of his connections, we must give a very strong message to those who have the same enthusiasm.”

Peters, also speaking at the OIC conference, said: “Ensuring Muslim communities in New Zealand feel safe and secure is a particular focus.”

The deputy leader, who is also the foreign minister, said New Zealand authorities would make sure “no stone stays unturned” in the prosecution of the alleged attacker.

## 29, 'We would never put that image on page 1': how we covered Christchurch

https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2019/apr/06/christchurch-shooting-mosque-how-we-covered-story

> From first whispers to horrified aftermath, this was a story which required a fast, careful response. Here our editors and writers explain how we covered the Christchurch shootings

On Friday 15 March, 50 people were shot dead and 48 injured in attacks targeting Muslims at two mosques during Friday prayers in Christchurch. It was the worst mass shooting in New Zealand’s history. Across the Guardian’s three main offices – in London, Sydney and New York – we ensured our coverage of the shooting, its aftermath and the global reaction continued around the clock. Here, some of the Guardian’s key journalists and editors remember how they reported on the unfolding atrocity.

I’ve never reported on a terrorism event before. My bread and butter is bird stories, Jacinda Ardern profiles, child poverty and environmental yarns. So I learnt how to do this aspect of my job on the hoof, with guidance from my foreign editors in Sydney and London, who, unfortunately, have coordinated coverage of similar events dozens of times. Terrorism is not new, but terrorism in the south island of New Zealand took everyone by surprise.

Now the adrenaline and initial shock of the attacks has eased, New Zealanders are coming to terms with a new version of their peaceful island home. A place where our Muslim brothers and sisters no longer feel safe.

Our prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, steered her country through this turbulent week with grace and dignity. She refused to say the alleged killer’s name, stripping him of power and notoriety. Instead she, and New Zealanders, have wrapped the Muslim community in aroha (love), and are looking ahead for how New Zealand can heal itself after this trauma, and ease simmering racial tensions.

From a personal point of view, the full impact of the tragedy has yet to hit home. During my week of reporting in Christchurch my head was full of logistics and practicalities. In many ways, I would have liked to have grieved among my fellow Kiwis: taken flowers to the memorial, joined in waiata [Māori songs] at Hagley Park, and participated in the two-minute silence.

My country is changed, but it is not broken. If anything, New Zealand is stronger than ever before. We know who we are, and we know who we’re not. The alleged killer is not us. Our home will be peaceful again.

The first sign that there was anything amiss in Christchurch was a text message sent to me from Eleanor before noon on Friday 15 March. She was in Christchurch reporting on another story - the measles outbreak – so it was quite a surprise when her message came through: “Shooting at Christchurch mosque heading there now”. But it wasn’t until her second message, which arrived moments later, that we had a sense of the scale of the story: “20 shots 6 people down”. We started a live blog, anchored in Sydney with Eleanor filing regular updates, and built up our coverage as the story grew.

It soon became clear that the alleged gunman had livestreamed the attack on Facebook. I first came across the video on Twitter – initially I thought it looked just like a violent video game. My first thought was: this cannot be real. I watched several minutes of it before realising that I was wrong.

There was no discussion about using the footage: it was obvious that scenes of people being shot and killed should not be part of the Guardian’s coverage. Instead we mentioned the existence of the video in the blog.

Around the same time we became aware of the so-called manifesto and the fact that the alleged shooter was Australian.

We decided that we should report on some parts of the manifesto, especially the parts where the alleged gunman wrote about himself and his motivations, but not parts that included incitements to violence or racism. Looking back, I wish I had decided against using the term “manifesto”, which I think gives the document more weight that it deserves. In retrospect, “statement” or “document” would have been better.

Once the “manifesto” was out, the comment team in Sydney got in touch with Jason Wilson and asked him to write for us about online fascism. Jason is a writer and academic who is an expert in rightwing extremism and - crucially - is also Australian.

By the end of the day in Australia we had several separate stories, as well as the blog: a piece that reconstructed the horror of the attack from witness accounts, a story on Australian media broadcasting footage from the alleged gunman’s live stream of the killings, a piece on what we knew about the suspect, a “what we know so far” piece and several videos - including the very strong words from Ardern “utterly rejecting” the shooter’s actions. US reporter Lois Beckett pulled together a story on previous attacks linked to white supremacism, UK-based New Zealander Elle Hunt wrote about the shock of terrorism arriving in her peaceful home country, and in Australia, a reporter was dispatched to the suspect’s home town of Grafton.

In the first few hours after the attack we focused not on the gunman or his agenda, but on the victims, the survivors, the impact on Christchurch and the wider country, and Ardern’s message.

In the days that followed we continued to ask ourselves questions about our coverage. When Ardern announced she would not mention the suspect’s name, we had a debate about following suit and ultimately decided that journalists must report the facts and that includes the name of the man allegedly responsible for the attack. We also wanted to spend time on memorialising the victims, which we did with an immersive piece.

One of the main issues we need to tackle now is how we cover the suspect’s trial. He plans to represent himself, which could lead to the trial being used as a platform for his extremist views.

From Charlottesville, to Portland, to Christchurch, what I have observed is that there are three major factors at play in the genesis of white nationalist violence.

One is a large, international cohort of radicalised young men. Mostly they have been immersed in the ideology of violent white nationalism online, and/or by one or a number of emboldened, organised far-right groups. Their belief in ideas like “white genocide”, “demographic replacement”, or the influence of a shadowy cabal of “cultural Marxists” leads them to violent action.

Secondly, such men are afforded a platform, or cover, by ostensibly less extreme actors who organise online forums or street demonstrations under the banner of “free speech”. “Populist” or “civic nationalist” groups provide forums for those with more radical beliefs to proselytise and organise, and the barrier between such groups tends to be extremely porous.

Lastly, ostensibly mainstream rightwing media either defends big-tent far-right movements from criticism, deflects discussion to other matters, or mainstreams white-nationalist talking points. News Corp pundits like Tucker Carlson in the US or Andrew Bolt in Australia have espoused slightly softened versions of the narrative of “demographic replacement”. In general, the right is not interested in drawing a red line around the far right, and they have more and more in common.

The most important thing that my reporting has taught me is that law enforcement agencies – in the US and around the world – have systematically underestimated the danger posed by rightwing extremism. This needs to change.

Not only police but segments of the media have underplayed this danger. And that may be because rightwing media throughout the English speaking world promote attitudes — especially Islamophobia — which overlap with the beliefs of white nationalists.

Media reform also needs to be part of the picture, as does people power. When large numbers of people show up to counterprotest at rightwing rallies, they rarely become violent, and over time the movements organising them run out of steam. Antifascism should not be the preserve of radical activists. It should be the instinctive response of everyone who lives in a constitutional democracy, and we should view it as a civic duty.

The policy here is that we don’t want to glorify an act of terror, give it unjustified or gratuitous prominence, or fall prey to a perpetrator’s propaganda, so it was immediately clear that we shouldn’t use any of his material. It is our purpose, however, to report the news, and through careful choice of images supplied by trusted sources, we try to give our readers some evidence of what’s happening. The shots we published showed the general scene, geographic location, emergency services tending to victims who were unidentifiable survivors and concerned members of the community. Once the main suspect’s identity had been confirmed via official sources we searched for images of him that were not from the live stream and that didn’t play to his political agenda. We made a deliberate decision, in this instance, that although we would publish his image in print, it wouldn’t be on the front page.

Over the past few years, coverage of attacks on Muslims has evolved from minimising them as perpetrated by isolated players, “lone wolves”, to acknowledging that there is in fact a more coherent ideological movement behind violent manifestations of Islamophobia. This acknowledgment, however, often finds a way of denying the pervasiveness and danger of anti-Muslim and anti-immigration sentiment, by attributing it to either a backlash against terrorism, or high immigration.

But the Christchurch attack, and the clear online radicalisation of the attacker, has forced many to reckon with the fact that there are now other factors – global white supremacy networks and an unregulated web – having an influence that had hitherto not been taken seriously. In that sense Christchurch has been a watershed event, and there have already been measures taken by online platforms to limit content. US responses I received to my coverage in particular, far more readily accepted the conclusion that such attacks were no longer isolated from everyday Islamophobia.

But while covering the shooting, it became clear to me that what I had been attempting to do for years, namely, making a link between the normalising of Islamophobia in politics and non-rightwing media, and its violent manifestations, was something that many still refused to accept in the UK, choosing instead to see this as “silencing” or “censorship”. In that sense Christchurch was far from being a watershed moment: if anything it entrenched the defensive view that far-right terrorism has no relation to the mainstream political climate.

And so the role of the liberal media becomes even more crucial in framing and presenting anti-Muslim views, and often gets it wrong by falling for false equivalence or the excuse of “legitimate concerns”. Violence or hate speech against Muslims or Muslim immigrants should be covered with the same unequivocal tone as that against other minority groups.

One of the biggest difficulties in covering these kinds of incidents is that there is an immediate and entirely understandable demand for a broader explanation of the significance of a terrorist attack, what it might signal in terms of future threat or the evolution of terrorist groups today, whether it’s related to other recent attacks and so on. The problem is that we can only have a definitive answer to these questions months, if not years, after the event. So if as a reporter you need to plunge in and get deep into what is happening right now, as an analyst you have to try to hold back, keep some distance, make some calls to people who have important information or insights and only then start writing.

This has been called a watershed moment. But watershed moments are pretty rare. How politicians and the public react is absolutely key. The threat from rightwing extremism has been signalled again and again by security officials, as well as, clearly, by atrocities, but it has not attracted the same resources or interest as the threat from Islamist militancy, and that’s a political decision. I think one good thing that has come out of the New Zealand attack is a new realisation of the international nature of rightwing extremism and that it needs to be fought with many of the same collaborative, global tools as are now deployed with some effect against Islamist militancy.

The main thing is to see terrorism in a broader way. It’s an important area because so much feeds into it: politics, social trends, demography, ideas and so on. The two elements that I always try to stress are that terrorism is a social activity like any other, just with morally abhorrent consequences and aims, and that a long perspective is really important. We all have a role to play in pushing back against the extremists, the conspiracy theorists and others who contribute in any way to an environment that makes some of us less safe.

## 30, 49 shot dead in attack on two Christchurch mosques

New Zealand PM says attack was terrorism
Man in 20s charged with murder
Police find explosives attached to cars
New Zealand attack – latest updates


Forty-nine people have been shot dead and 48 injured in attacks targeting Muslims at two mosques during Friday prayers in Christchurch, in the worst mass shooting in New Zealand’s history.

The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, described the atrocity as a terrorist attack and said Friday had been “one of New Zealand’s darkest days”. Police commissioner Mike Bush said explosive devices in a car had been defused and urged all mosques across the country to close their doors for the time being.

A man in his late 20s was arrested and charged with murder. He will appear in court on Saturday morning. Two other armed suspects were being held in custody. Police said they were trying to determine how they might be involved.

Police have not named any of the suspects, but a man identifying himself as Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old born in Australia, broadcast livestream footage on Facebook showing him driving to a mosque, entering and shooting randomly at people inside.

New Zealand’s entire police arsenal and personnel were deployed throughout the country and en masse in Christchurch, the South Island’s largest city, which is known to have an active white-supremacist subculture.

Hotels in the inner city stationed security guards at their entrances, and armed police protected landmarks of significance, including the courthouse and Christchurch hospital, which is believed to have been a further target. A Christchurch spokesperson told local media police were concerned the suspects had plans to target the victims of the mosque attack as they were transported to hospital.

A “manifesto” was posted online before the attacks, in which the suspected gunman espoused far-right and anti-immigrant ideology.

The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, called the massacre a “rightwing extremist attack” and said one suspect was Australian-born, without giving further details. Ardern condemned the ideology of the people behind the shootings, saying: “You may have chosen us but we utterly reject and condemn you.”

New Zealand’s threat level has been raised from low to high. None of the suspects were on terrorism watchlists, Ardern said.

As dusk fell, people who escaped the two shootings returned to the scene, where they waited at the police cordon in an attempt to reach an unknown number of people still being held in a back room of Al Noor mosque, where 30 people were killed in the first attack. Ten people were later killed at the Linwood Islamic Centre, four miles (6km) away.

Relatives of those inside estimated about 100 people remained locked inside the mosque.

A trickle of Christchurch residents stood with the victims keeping vigil, rubbing their shoulders, offering food and logistical support. “We’re so sorry,” they repeated, and: “This is not us, this is not New Zealand.” Some in typical New Zealand fashion were using black humour, evidently as a coping mechanism in the midst of an overwhelming tragedy.

Hassan, 29, a Sri Lankan Muslim who has lived in New Zealand for six months, said he came to the country for its “peace, and because there are no wars”. He did not wish to give his last name.

He was at the Linwood mosque’s Friday prayer service when the shooting began, and hit the floor as women around him rose up and screamed at the gunmen “Do not come here,” some of them charging towards the gunman.

“The shooter was screaming a lot and waving the gun in every direction, shooting, shooting, shooting,” he said. “I don’t know who of my friends is dead or alive now. I am waiting. Police told me: ‘I am sorry, this is the first time this has ever happened in this country.’”

Hassan’s home is within the Al Noor police cordon, and he was unable to return on Friday night.

Mohammed, a Fijian Muslim who also did not wish to give his last name, was in Al Noor mosque when the shooting started. He escaped through the back door, but said his son-in-law was shot in the shoulder and his nephew was trapped inside.

“I am happy that I am alive,” he said. “I am new to New Zealand and at the mosque you find your friends and family. They are after the Muslims. They only see religion … They don’t see people any more.

“We are not safe any more. Where are we safe now?”

As shots rang out, police put the city in lockdown and evacuated nearby climate change protests, with children separated from their relatives looked after by council staff until it was safe.

Those who live near the two mosques reported people climbing over fences to escape, and begging for help as the massacre unfolded.

The gunman entered Al Noor mosque in central Christchurch and opened fire at 1.40pm local time. An estimated 400 people were inside for Friday prayers. Len Peneha, a witness, told Associated Press he saw a man dressed in black go into the mosque and heard dozens of shots, followed by people running away in terror.

He said he saw the gunman flee before the emergency services arrived. Peneha said he went into the mosque to try to help: “I saw dead people everywhere.”

Another man who was at the mosque told TVNZ he had not seen his wife, who was also in the mosque, since the shooting. The man, who was in a wheelchair, pushed himself out to the car park.

“It was very peaceful, calm and quiet, as it is when the sermon starts, you could hear a pin drop. Then suddenly the shooting started,” he said. “I saw about 20-plus people, some were dead, some were screaming. On the left there were 10-plus people, some were dead.”

The killer or killers then moved on to the Linwood mosque and killed a further 10 people.

In a statement just after 4pm local time, the police said Christchurch was in lockdown and urged people to stay indoors.

A Christchurch hospital spokesman said some victims were being treated at the emergency department but he could not provide numbers because the hospital was in lockdown.

The mayor of Christchurch, Lianne Dalziel, said the city was in shock: “This has come as a bolt from the blue ... It just feels like it’s not what would happen in a place like New Zealand.”

Earlier, Ardern said many of those directly affected by the shooting might be migrants to New Zealand.

“They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home. They are us,” she told reporters. “The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not. They have no place in New Zealand.”

Members of the Bangladesh cricket team, who were outside Al Noor mosque when the shootings occurred, were unhurt. The team were due to play the final Test match of their New Zealand tour in Christchurch on Saturday. The game was cancelled. The New Zealand cricket team sent its “heartfelt condolences” in a post on Twitter.

All team members and staff caught up in the incident returned safely to their hotel, Bangladesh Cricket confirmed, after taking refuge in the immediate aftermath of the attack in the dressing rooms at Hagley Oval.

The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has urged Australians in Christchurch to follow the instructions of local authorities, but has not changed its travel advice from normal safety precautions.As the swell of family members grew outside the cordon at Al Noor mosque, local Christchurch residents began walking to the scene on foot, carrying flowers and laying them beneath a tree, and approaching survivors offering help.

Elsewhere, Christchurch seemed eerily deserted, the pubs and restaurants that would usually be bustling on a Friday closed as the city mourned.

## 31, Christchurch gunman pleads guilty to New Zealand mosque attacks that killed 51

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/christchurch-shooting-brenton-tarrant-pleads-guilty-to-new-zealand-mosque-attacks-that-killed-51

> Sudden change of plea by Australian attacker accused of killing dozens of worshippers comes as a shock to victims’ families

The Australian man charged with murdering 51 people in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, has suddenly changed his plea to admit all charges at a hastily arranged court appearance.

On 15 March last year, a man dressed in military fatigues and armed with semi-automatic weapons shot dead 51 worshippers at Al Noor and Linwood mosques in inner-city Christchurch. Forty-nine people were also injured in the attacks, which were livestreamed on the internet.

The horrific attack shocked New Zealand and is regarded as the worst massacre in the country’s modern history, as well as the country’s largest ever criminal prosecution.

The man accused of the shootings, Brenton Tarrant, a former gym instructor from Australia, was charged with the murders and had maintained a not-guilty plea throughout. His trial was set down for the 2 June in Christchurch high court.

This has now been called off and he has been convicted of all charges, with sentencing to occur later this year.

On Thursday in a court appearance arranged at short notice, the details of which were known to few, Tarrant had changed his plea, and is now pleading guilty to all charges; 51 of murder, 40 of attempted murder and one charge under the Terrorism Suppression act.

Tarrant did not appear in the courtroom but changed his plea via video link from his Auckland prison cell. It came on the first day New Zealand went into nationwide lockdown in an attempt to control the coronavirus pandemic.

Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the guilty plea would be a “relief” for families.

“The guilty plea today will provide some relief to the many people whose lives were shattered by what happened on March 15,” Ardern said.

“These guilty pleas and conviction bring accountability for what happened and also save the families who lost loved ones, those who were injured, and other witnesses, the ordeal of a trial.

The change of plea came as a shock for Kiwis, most of whom were in lockdown in their own homes, police commissioner Mike Bush said.

“Arrangements for the court hearing were made at short notice after the defendant indicated, via his counsel on Tuesday afternoon, that he wished to be brought before the court,” Bush said in a statement.

“Police appreciate this news will come as a surprise to the victims and the public, some of whom may have wished to be present in the courtroom.”

Bush said the two imams from Al Noor and Linwood Avenue mosques attended as representatives of the victims, and suppression orders were put in place to allow as many victims as possible to be told of the guilty plea before it was released to the public.

Families of the bereaved and victims who spoke to the Guardian said they had not even known that a hearing for Tarrant was planned for Thursday.

“The news is fresh and I don’t know whether to believe it or not,” said Maysoon Salama. Her son, Atta Elayyan, was killed and her husband was badly injured in the attack. “It’s unbelievable really.” But she was relieved “in a way”, she said.

“There has been a lot emotionally up and down for us,” she said, adding that the gunman had treated the court system “like a game”, further distressing families.

She had not been aware that a hearing was taking place, and said the Muslim community had been preoccupied with the four-week national lockdown that began in New Zealand at midnight to tackle Covid-19.

News media were told of the court appearance on Wednesday but were not told what it would be about, and notice of the hearing came just hours before the Covid-19 lockdown began.

Salama said the bereaved and victims had received a phone call from a lawyer representing them after the hearing, but before the news was made public.

Bush said 15 March had changed New Zealand forever. “I want to acknowledge the victims, their families and the community of Christchurch – the many lives that were changed forever,” Bush said. “They have inspired all of us to be a kind and more tolerant community.”

Sentencing will not take place until it is possible for all victims who wish to attend the hearing to do so, police said, and that will not be possible “for some time” due to the Covid-19 epidemic.

Tarrant has been remanded in custody until 1 May 2020.

 This article was amended on 28 April 2020. An earlier version incorrectly described Tarrant as being armed with “automatic weapons”.

## 32, 'No right to livestream murder': Ardern leads push against online terror content

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/24/christchurch-call-ardern-leads-push-against-online-terror-content

> New Zealand PM launches ‘Christchurch Call’ to build support to eliminate extremist material on social media

New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern is to spearhead a push to combat violent extremism and terrorism on social media in the wake of the Christchurch attacks, saying the gunman did not have “a right to livestream the murder of 50 people”.

Ardern and French president Emmanuel Macron will host a summit in Paris on 15 May, rallying tech companies and other concerned countries to commit to a pledge known as the “Christchurch Call” – a vow to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online.

Ardern said online platforms had been used in a “unique” way to disseminate and publicise video of the Christchurch attack, and there had been rallying cries for New Zealand to take on a leadership role, but the country of fewer than 5 million people could not do it alone.

France was a natural partner, Ardern said, due to its G7 presidency, focus on combating the use of the internet for terrorist purposes, and being the host country for a G7 digital ministers meeting in mid-May.

“We want to maintain the principles of a free, open and secure internet, but this isn’t about freedom of expression, this is about preventing violent extremism and terrorism online. I don’t think anyone would argue that the terrorist on the 15th of March had a right to livestream the murder of 50 people,” Ardern said on Wednesday.

“We all need to act, and that includes social media providers taking more responsibility for the content that is on their platforms … it’s critical that technology platforms like Facebook are not perverted as a tool for terrorism, and instead become part of a global solution to countering extremism.”

Ardern said she had already spoken to global tech company chief executives, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, and those of Twitter, Microsoft and Google. She described the conversations as “really positive”.

“No tech company, just like no government, wishes to see violent extremism and terrorism online, so we have a starting point that is one of unity,” said Ardern.

“What we’re trying to tackle here is a global issue and I think it requires a global response. New Zealand is looking to play a leadership role because what happened here on the 15th of March was unprecedented in the way that is used the internet, so with that does come a responsibility to try and make change.”

The text of the Christchurch Call to action was still being finalised, Ardern said, but there would be a strong focus on practical action, and not just aspirational rhetoric.

Ardern said a number of countries such as France, Ireland, New Zealand and Germany already had internet legislation in place, but more needed to be done towards ensuring better global protections, and tech companies had a responsibility to make their platforms safer.

The Christchurch mosque gunman livestreamed the mosque shootings on Facebook and they were viewed thousands of times before moderators were alerted 30 minutes after the shootings.

The video of the mosque attack was also copied and shared widely on the internet, and Facebook has said that since the attacks it has intercepted and prevented more than 1m attempts to upload and distribute the video again.

The New Zealand government announced on Wednesday that it would offer all victims of the Christchurch mosque shootings permanent residency in the country, an offer that extends to their immediate family members, and which they have two years to take up.

> Three mothers who lost sons in the terrorist attacks say working to prevent others suffering the same violence has both helped and frustrated them

So many of their sons loved football. The game meant inclusion and friendship regardless of language or culture; it cemented bonds in their own community and promised a way to forge new ones outside of it. As Noraini Abbas readies team shirts and prepares lunches for an indoor football festival on Wednesday, she recalls years of ferrying her soccer-mad sons to games in Christchurch, New Zealand, on weekend mornings which always seemed freezing, no matter the time of year.

But Wednesday’s schedule of friendly matches is different from games before. Abbas is hosting the second annual event in memory of her youngest son, Sayyad Abbas Milne, and 50 other Muslim worshipers who were killed when a white supremacist opened fire at their mosques during Friday prayers, four years ago.

Sayyad – 14 when he died – was the youngest of five shining soccer stars murdered on 15 March 2019. Now their mothers are each, in different ways, working towards the same goal: curbing the hateful violence that was visited on their children before it can take children from other families. The work, they say, has frustrated and healed them.

“When we talk about getting help, people might get therapy or counselling,” says Abbas, who has started work since the attack as an outreach coordinator for Muslims at Purapura Whetu, a Christchurch-based social services provider. “The best help that I’ve had is getting to work with and for the community.”

The horror of the 2019 terrorist attack has been at times intensified, and at others muted, by the fact that it happened in New Zealand – a relatively quiet and peaceful country that was shaken by a rare mass shooting, but responded with compassion for the victims and rejection of the Australian gunman’s racist motivations.

Jacinda Ardern, then prime minister, was swift to ban all weapons used in the attack – but four years later, a coronial process investigating the deaths is in its early stages and many of the bereaved and survivors are still seeking catharsis and facts.

The sense of limbo means the fourth anniversary is fraught and tinged with uncertainty. Some families asked the government to forgo any memorial service this year, while Abbas is part of another group of women who are hosting a week of unity-themed events – including her day of friendly futsal (a fast-paced, five a side version of indoor soccer) for 42 school children aged 10 to 14.

“The day isn’t about remembering that we lost our children because we remember our children all the time,” says Abbas, who survived the attack at Masjid an-Nur, the first mosque the terrorist struck, in a different room to her son. “We want the wider community to get together on the day, and for people to really remember what they did for their Muslim neighbours on 15 March 2019.”

The attacks did not drastically alter New Zealand’s way of life; instead, the fallout continues to roil the community that was targeted, where many Muslims knew dozens of the men, women and children killed. Over time, a feeling has grown among some New Zealanders that neither the victims of the shooting, nor the terrorist bear any relationship to them.

“I almost feel like New Zealand has shut the door and they’re getting on with their lives, which I can understand,” says Rosemary Omar, the mother of Tariq Omar, who was 24 when he died. “But I want people to understand that this could happen to another community.”

Tariq – the second of four children – came home from school each day with pockets full of stones, and went on to complete a geology degree. The environmentalist and strict vegetarian was fastidious about his nutrition and training for football.

“There’d be about three or four games every Saturday,” Omar says. “They’d start at some ungodly hour and the day would just progress from one game to another.”

Tariq played in his club’s first eleven and the nine year-olds he coached won a tournament days before he died. An annual cup is held in his honour. He never learned to drive – Tariq was dyslexic and worried he would fail the written test – so his parents were a fixture at every match.

On the day her son was killed, Omar drove him, as she always did, to Masjid an-Nur and waited in the car while Tariq went inside to pray. Moments later, gunfire began.

Omar now works to help coordinate feedback and questions for the government from Muslims in Christchurch, about progress on a wide-ranging work programme it committed to after an inquiry into the attacks. Change is slow, she says, and it is sometimes difficult to get evidence from officials that movement is happening.

Tariq’s mother has left his bedroom untouched, drawers full of stones. His portrait sat on an empty chair at his older sister’s wedding, and Rosemary imagines him playing with her first grandchild, now aged two.

“It’s a joy to see there’s a future,” she says. “There’s sadness too, because Tariq would have been a great uncle and he would have bought Amira a football and been teaching her the moves.”

As a little boy, Tariq attended a Muslim kindergarten in Christchurch where the ripples of devastation from the attack are evident. Past students, as well as parents of pupils, were among those killed. One student, aged four, who attended prayers with her father, survived gunshot wounds.

Maysoon Salama, who runs the kindergarten, was also nursing hurt; her husband was badly injured in the attack and her son, Atta Elayyan, 33 – a futsal goalkeeper for New Zealand’s national team – was killed. Her Muslim faith remains as strong as ever, she says. But much else is different.

“I wasn’t really into politics before,” says Salama, who has a doctorate in biology. “I was living my life, enjoying my family and my kids and doing my job as an educator.”

The apple of her eye was her eldest son Atta; who was beloved by the kindergarten pupils when he drove their van, who built his own software company, who played the shooting game Counter-Strike under the name “crazyarab”, who once scored a goal for his futsal team from his goalkeeper’s position.

“Even after he got married, he would come in every day and say, ‘What’s the plan, Mum?’ It still rings in my mind,” Salama says. She kept his school woodworking projects: a coat hanger; a spoon that says “kiss the chef.”

Now, Salama sits on committees advising the government about their social cohesion efforts, particularly in the education sector, and about the needs of the bereaved and survivors. She has published a book – written for Atta’s daughter, who was two when he died – explaining grief and loss to children, which was distributed in New Zealand’s schools.

Last September, she spoke on a United Nations panel about the rights and needs of terrorism victims, alongside a mother bereaved in the 2011 massacre by a white supremacist in Norway. Both women listed similar concerns, years apart: insufficient mental health support, a lack of accountability, and the insidious global spread of racist online extremism that fuelled both crimes.

“It was a chance to reassure myself that my feelings and what I’m going through is legitimate, that I’m not exaggerating it and I’m not alone,” Salama says.

In Christchurch, she worries about intergenerational trauma in a small community where she knows everyone’s children.

“Loss of confidence, loss of businesses, loss of work, physical issues that people are facing are really hard for families to handle on their own,” Salama says.

In February, New Zealand’s incoming prime minister, Chris Hipkins, announced a hate speech law proposed by Ardern after the attack – a lightning rod for political controversy – would be shelved and referred to an independent commission for advice.

It was disappointing for Salama, because, she adds: “Islamophobia is on the rise in New Zealand, definitely.”

For all their efforts to influence laws and policies, she, Omar and Abbas are all driven by something more simple.

At the August 2020 sentencing for the terrorist, who was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole after pleading guilty to all charges (he has since sought leave to appeal), Noraini Abbas told the court she would “live my life doing great things for our people, our community.”

She kept her word. Abbas manages Christchurch’s first Muslim women’s volleyball team, which will play a Filipino women’s side this week. In the absence of an official public memorial after the attacks, Abbas gathered support from residents near Lyttelton’s Pony Point, a quiet spot overlooking the ocean, for something informal.

There, locals planted 51 trees – one for each person killed.

When the young futsal players assemble before her on Wednesday wearing yellow – Sayyad’s favourite colour – his mother knows what she wants to say.

“If someone does something bad to you, you show them love,” she will tell them. “This person hated us so much, but we want to teach people what love and kindness is.”

## 34, They Are Us: controversial film about Christchurch attacks put on hold

https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/23/they-are-us-controversial-film-about-christchurch-attacks-put-on-hold

> Fictional account of mosque shootings starring Rose Byrne as Jacinda Ardern has been criticised as ‘insensitive’

Work on the controversial film They Are Us, which dramatises the 15 March Christchurch mosque shootings, has been put on hold.

The film takes its name from a phrase in a speech made by prime minister Jacinda Ardern following the killing of 51 Muslim worshippers by a white supremacist in 2019. It focused on Ardern’s response following the attacks, with actor Rose Byrne slated to play Ardern.

But the film’s announcement prompted outcry from New Zealand’s Muslim community, many of whom criticised its premise as “insensitive” and “obscene”. Ardern herself has had no involvement with the project.

The film’s director, Andrew Niccol, told New Zealand news sites via a statement that he was “saddened by the pain caused to families of the victims,” and that the film’s development was on hold, until further consultation with the Muslim community could be carried out – but he still hoped it could be made.

“Our hope for this film, concieved by producer Ayman Jamal, which will take years to complete, is that it will honour the survivors, and the lives lost,” Niccol said in the statement. This was the first public comment he has made since the film’s announcement in June.

Writer and community advocate, Guled Mire, said the film being put on hold was “a testament to the response and the message that New Zealand has sent as a country, as a nation, behind the Muslim community itself – which is something that needs to be applauded”.

He said work on the proposed film should not restart: “Not now, not tomorrow, not ever, period.”

A leaked copy of a draft script for the film prompted further backlash earlier this month. At the time, Aya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein was killed in the attack, said she was deeply troubled by reports of what the draft contained.

“It’s just wrong on so many levels. This has affected many people beyond the scope of directly impacted victims..”

An online petition launched to shut down the film’s production received nearly 75,000 signatures. Its producer, Philippa Campbell, resigned from the project shortly after.

Niccol’s statement said: “I am deeply saddened by the pain caused to the families of the victims, due to the wrongful distribution of our draft script for They Are Us. The script is far from final, and never intended to be shared with the affected members of the Muslim community at such an early stage.”

He said the sole purpose of the script “was to gauge interest of potential financiers”.

The Guardian has requested comment from Niccol via the film’s studio, FilmNation Entertainment, and Niccol’s agency, CAA.

## 36, Christchurch attack: suspect had white-supremacist symbols on weapons

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/christchurch-shooting-new-zealand-suspect-white-supremacist-symbols-weapons

> Man to appear in court charged with murder after 49 people shot dead at two mosques

New Zealand shooting – latest updates


The suspected perpetrator of a massacre at two mosques in New Zealand displayed white supremacist symbols during the deadly assault that killed 49 people and triggered heightened security at mosques around the world.

The attack in Christchurch, the worst mass shooting in the nation’s history, shattered the illusion that New Zealand was one of the few countries beyond the reach of global terrorism.

The carnage, described by New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, as one of its “darkest days”, prompted prayers and vigils around the world, and revulsion that live footage of the atrocity was allowed to circulate on social media.

Ardern said she would consider a total ban on semi-automatic firearms after the alleged gunman obtained five guns legally. “I can tell you one thing right now: our gun laws will change,” she told reporters.

Christchurch remained on lockdown on Saturday as the country’s security threat level was raised from low to high. Mosques across New Zealand and in other countries were warned to be vigilant.

In the UK and the US, police stepped up patrols in areas with large Muslim populations and around places of worship in direct response to the attack.

Responding to the attack on Friday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned there was an urgent need to tackle Islamophobia across the world.

A man in his late 20s will appear in court in Christchurch on Saturday morning, charged with murder. Police did not name him or two other suspects who were being questioned, but Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian man, identified himself as being behind the attack.

Some witnesses criticised the emergency services for being slow to respond to the shooting, claiming it took up to 20 minutes for the police to arrive on the scene in the largest city in the country’s South Island.

The attack, launched during Friday prayers when both mosques were packed, was livestreamed via a camera strapped to the perpetrator.

Horrific images of bloodshed and people desperately trying to evade the gunman were copied and shared on social media sites including YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, which struggled to remove the footage. Mainstream media organisations were criticised for hosting clips.

The gunman arrived at Al Noor mosque at 1.40pm, opening fire on about 400 people. He killed 41 people before driving four miles to the Linwood Islamic Centre, where another seven people were shot dead. One of the 48 people injured in the attacks later died in hospital. A bomb disposal team was called in to dismantle explosive devices found in a stopped car.

At Al Noor mosque, Khaled Al-Nobani said a man entered with two rifles, one a “pump-action [gun]”, and “started shooting everyone – young people, old women”.

He added: “He shot the first one on the gate, two people in the corridor, and go inside started shooting everyone.” One man was killed in front of his three children, Al-Nobani said.

He claimed police took 20 minutes to arrive. “We are in the middle of the city. The middle of Christchurch. There was no traffic about. You need two-minute [maximum] response.”

Carl Pomare and a colleague were driving past the mosque at the time of the attack. “I saw lots of people running outside the mosque … In the next second there was rapid fire and people were being knocked down like tenpins. I saw them being hit from behind, I saw them falling to the ground,” he told the BBC.

The pair stopped to help the injured. “There were lots of bodies and there was no sirens, no police or ambulance because this had just happened … It was a scene of carnage – we were there for a good 15 or 20 minutes, just civilians, helping these people as much as we could until more support came in,” Pomare added.

A survivor of the attack at Linwood described how a man tackled the shooter. “The young guy who usually takes care of the mosque … he saw an opportunity and pounced on [the gunman] and took his gun,” Syed Mazharuddin told the New Zealand Herald.

“The hero tried to chase and he couldn’t find the trigger in the gun … He ran behind him but there were people waiting for him in the car and he fled.”

Images from the gunman’s camera showed weapons and ammunition displaying white-supremacist symbols, including the names of a Swedish child killed in a lorry attack in 2017 and a man hailed for defeating Muslims in an eighth-century battle.

One ammunition clip had the words “For Rotherham”, in an apparent reference to child grooming gangs in the UK town.

In a 74-page document posted online, Tarrant said he wanted to create “an atmosphere of fear” against Muslims and claimed the Norwegian white supremacist and mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik had given his “blessing” to the atrocity.

The document calls for the targeting of Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, along with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

Describing himself as a “regular white man from a regular family” who “decided to take a stand to ensure a future for my people”, Tarrant said he wanted his attack to send a message that “nowhere in the world is safe”.

Ardern said the shootings were an extraordinary and unprecedented act of terrorism. Muslim immigrants had “chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home. They are us,” the prime minister said. “The person who has perpetuated this violence is against us is not us. They have no place in New Zealand.”

World leaders expressed sorrow, shock and anger. The Queen – New Zealand’s head of state – sent prayers and condolences to the bereaved, saying she was “saddened by the appalling events in Christchurch”.

Pope Francis denounced the “senseless acts of violence” and offered solidarity and prayers.

Donald Trump expressed his “warmest sympathy and best wishes” to the people of New Zealand after “the horrible massacre in the mosques”. The US president tweeted that “innocent people have so senselessly died” and added: “The US stands by New Zealand for anything we can do.”

The British prime minister, Theresa May, called the assault a “sickening act of violence”.

## 37, Christchurch mosque shooter claims guilty plea obtained under duress, expected to appeal

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/08/christchurch-mosque-shooter-claims-guilty-plea-obtained-under-duress-expected-to-appeal

> Imam says killer is ‘grandstanding’ and should not be allowed to re-traumatise New Zealanders

The Christchurch mosque terrorist has filed complaints alleging that his treatment in New Zealand custody – including the refusal to refer to him by name – constituted a violation of his human rights, and that his guilty pleas were obtained under duress.

Brenton Tarrant, an Australian white supremacist who murdered 51 people in an attack on two Christchurch mosques in March 2019, said via a memorandum from his lawyer Dr Tony Ellis that his guilty pleas were obtained under duress due to mistreatment in custody. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in August 2020. Ellis told local media outlets that he expected the gunman, Tarrant, to file an appeal against his convictions.

In the wake of the attacks, prime minister Jacinda Ardern vowed she would never say the attacker’s name, and many other government bodies followed her lead. “He sought many things from his act of terror but one was notoriety, that is why you will never hear me mention his name,” Ardern said of the gunman at the time. “He is a terrorist. He is a criminal. He is an extremist. But he will, when I speak, be nameless. … He may have sought notoriety but we, in New Zealand, will give nothing – not even his name.”

Imam Gamal Fouda, the imam of one of the mosques at the centre of the attacks, said the terrorist was “grandstanding” and attempting to further traumatise the families of those who he killed.

“I believe this unnamed terrorist wishes to become famous and [is] grandstanding, especially with the coroner’s inquiry due in early December this year,” he said. “This situation is causing further trauma to the whānau (families), and the terrorist should not be given the opportunity to re-traumatise all of us as New Zealanders.”

“I fully support what the New Zealand courts have done, and I request that all media whether in New Zealand or overseas do not provide the terrorist with any voice. I believe they should continue to disregard his name.”

“I don’t know how he can appeal it because he already admitted to what he’s done,” said Rashid Omar, whose son Tariq Omar was killed in the attacks, and who is co-chair of the 15th March Whānau Trust. “If it’s going to go ahead, it’s going to recreate all the trauma that we had. And I think that’s what he enjoys, what he wants us to feel – to go back to day one again, after two and a half years.”

The coroner’s office would not release the memo on Monday, saying in a written statement that “Chief Coroner Judge Marshall makes no comment in this matter,” and said the memo could be requested from Tarrant’s lawyer. Ellis declined to comment to the Guardian on the memo or to provide its full text, and said Tarrant had released it to only two local media outlets.

According to RNZ, one of the media outlets given the memo, Tarrant says he pleaded guilty to the charges because of the inhumane and degrading treatment he experienced while awaiting trial. He has been held in near 24-hour solitary confinement, and has highly limited access to news. Ellis also alleged his client had had correspondence withheld, including letters from the coroner and copies of the royal commission of inquiry.

“He sent me about 15 pages of narrative of how he had been treated since he’d been in prison,” Ellis told RNZ.

“He said because of how he was treated while he was awaiting trial and afterwards, [that affected] his will to carry on and he decided that the simplest way out was to plead guilty.”

“By this, he means he was subject to inhuman or degrading treatment whilst on remand, which prevented a fair trial.”

According to the outlets provided with the memo, Ellis writes that the chief coroner’s refusal to use Tarrant’s name – instead referring to him repeatedly as “the individual,” was a serious breach of human rights and an attempt render the offender a “non-person”, failed to provide him equal protection and equal treatment before the law and was “deeply offensive and unlawful”.

In both the royal commission’s full report into the attack and the coroner’s 47-page scope of inquiry, the terrorist is never referred to by name, only as “the individual”.

“What we’ve been doing, calling him ‘an individual’ is very, very polite,” Omar said. “To me [he] is nothing. He’s not even a human being. So I still call him ‘it’ – he doesn’t deserve any name at all.”

## 38, New Zealand honours ‘extraordinary’ bravery of 10 during Christchurch attacks

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/16/new-zealand-honours-extraordinary-bravery-of-10-during-christchurch-attacks

> Highest honours went to Naeem Rashid, who died while challenging the gunman, and Abdul Aziz who lured the attacker away from others

Ten people who risked their lives to save others during the 2019 Christchurch mosque massacres have been honoured in New Zealand’s most prestigious bravery awards.

“The courage demonstrated by these New Zealanders was selfless and extraordinary. They have our deepest respect and gratitude for their actions on that day,” said the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. “Each of them put their life on the line to save others. If not for their collective actions, the loss of life could have been even greater.”

The list includes two awards of the country’s highest bravery honour, the New Zealand Cross – an acknowledgment akin to the New Zealand Victoria Cross for gallantry.

On 15 March 2019, a white supremacist gunman killed 44 people at al Noor mosque during Friday prayers before driving to the Linwood mosque, where he killed another seven.

Dr Naeem Rashid was posthumously awarded the New Zealand Cross, after he disregarded his own safety to challenge the attacker in al Noor mosque. As the gunman came into the main prayer room and began firing shots, the congregation attempted to flee, but Rashid ran at the gunman.

“In so doing, he enabled others to escape and paid the ultimate price with the loss of his own life. I want to acknowledge Dr Rashid’s wife and family particularly, who will know all too well that his acts that day were a reflection of who he was as a person,” Ardern said.

Rashid’s wife, Ambreen Naeem, said in a statement she was grateful for the award. “Today we can’t see him, but he has spread his message of peace and love, all over the world.”

Abdul Aziz was also awarded the New Zealand Cross for also displaying great courage and bravery challenging the gunman. Aziz shouted provocations at the gunman to get him to refocus his attention on him, with the intention of preventing further loss of life. Aziz’s actions deterred the gunman from re-entering the Linwood Islamic Centre and ultimately forced him to flee the mosque.

“To be honest with you, I couldn’t even have the time to think about anything, I just wanted to get that guy, that coward,” Aziz told RNZ on Thursday.

While Aziz hoped no one would ever have to get an award again for helping save their community from terrorism, he acknowledged it felt good to be honoured. “It means a lot to all our community and all the Muslims and for me too, because all those times we’ve been the target, and this shows that people are with us.

“It feels good, like you’ve done something good in your life.”

There were also four awards of the New Zealand Bravery Decoration and four of the New Zealand Bravery Medal.

Senior constables Scott Carmody and Jim Manning were awarded the New Zealand Bravery Decoration for their exceptional courage in apprehending the gunman.

Canterbury District Commander Superintendent John Price said: “Jim and Scott are incredibly humble, but these awards are an important symbol of much more of than two heroic individuals, they say something about who we are as New Zealanders”.

Ziyaad Shah’s bravery shielding another worshipper with his body in al Noor mosque, while the gunman shot at them, hitting Shah twice, was acknowledged with the New Zealand Bravery Decoration.

Liam Beale, also awarded this decoration, had been driving past al Noor mosque but left his vehicle as he heard gunshots and people screaming. He stopped people from heading to the mosque, and then helped victims.

Lance Bradford, Wayne Maley, Mark Miller and Mike Robinson were awarded the New Zealand Bravery Medal. “They placed their lives at risk, bravely searching for victims, assisting them and moving them to safety, while the gunman was active in the area,” Ardern said. “On a day of such terrible loss and suffering, the actions of these 10 individuals demonstrated the humanity, decency and compassion that New Zealanders value and hold dear.”

 This article was amended on 17 December 2021. An earlier version said the New Zealand Cross was “an acknowledgment akin to the Victoria Cross, the UK’s most prestigious award for bravery”. The Victoria Cross is equal in stature to the George Cross in the UK honours system. In addition, the New Zealand Cross is primarily for civilians; in terms of direct comparisons with the UK, it is most similar to the George Cross.

We’re going to wrap up the blog. Thank you for following along. Here’s what has happened today:

Reuters have this interview with Farid Ahmed, whose wife Husna was killed in the attack.

Husna arrived in New Zealand aged 19, arriving from Bangladesh on her wedding day. Waiting to meet her was Farid, the man she would marry in a few hours, as their families had agreed.

A quarter of a century later, the life they had built together was torn apart at the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch when a gunman walked into the building, firing on worshippers at Friday prayers.

Husna encountered the gunman on his way out of the mosque. He shot her on the footpath. She fell and he fired two more shots, killing her instantly.

Farid managed to escape when he heard the shooting begin, returning when the gunman left, to find many of his friends and community members dead, and comfort those who were dying.

Farid found out about his wife’s death when a detective he knew called his niece as they waited outside the mosque.

She passed the phone: “I don’t want you to wait the whole night, Farid. Go home, she will not come,” Farid said the detective told him.

“At the moment I hear that, my response was I felt numb,” Farid told Reuters. “I had tears but I didn’t break down.” His niece crumbled.

Based on what eyewitnesses told him, Farid said instead of hiding, Husna helped women and children inside the mosque and ran to the front of the building to look for him.

“She’s such a person who always put other people first and she was even not afraid to give her life saving other people,” Farid said. He also had this message for his wife’s killer.

“I have no grudge against you, I never hated you, I will never hate you.”

A vascular surgeon who operated on a four-year-old girl who was critically injured in Friday’s Mosque attack wept while describing her condition to reporters in Christchurch on Wednesday afternoon.

Dr Adib Khanafer, known in typical Kiwi fashion as Eddie, said he was completing another surgery when he was told he was needed in an emergency operation.

Speaking through tears, Khanafer said he was “really sad to see a young girl on the table with vascular injury” but that repairing her injury was a “highlight of my career.”

“I have four kids,” Khanafer said. “The youngest is 7, the oldest is 14, and I just imagine this was one of my kids. I was able to do my job and I left my emotions until after… after I had repaired her.

“I am from England. I am a Muslim. And I am Arab. And all my colleagues, Kiwis, have not stopped emailing me, texting me, and sending me flowers.”

The girl was transferred to Starship Children’s Hospital in Auckland on Friday night, and her father, who was also in intensive care, was transferred to another hospital in Auckland on Saturday.

Dr Dominic Fleischer, who was the lead clinician in the emergency department on Friday, said he did not expect to see a traumatic event like this in Christchurch.

“I still expect the next big earthquake, but nothing like this,” he said.

Fleischer said that only one of the 48 people who made it to hospital died after arrival. He commended all hospital staff for ensuring that patients received the best care available.

“We never ran out of trauma teams,” he said. “No patient waited to be seen… everyone was seen as soon as they got to us.”

A man accused of sharing video of a massacre in New Zealand has been jailed by a judge until his next court appearance in mid-April.

Philip Arps, 44, appeared in a Christchurch court Wednesday on two charges of distributing the killer’s livestream video of last week’s attack on Al Noor mosque, a violation of the country’s objectionable publications law. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison.

Arps, heavily tattooed and dressed in a T-shirt and sweatpants, hasn’t entered a plea. He remained expressionless during the hearing, his hands clasped behind his back.

Judge Stephen O’Driscoll denied him bail.

Charging documents accuse Arps of distributing the video on Saturday, one day after the massacre.

Arps owns a Christchurch business that had company vans emblazoned with neo-Nazi references.

Ardern said that police officers, including the armed offenders squad, were the first to administer first aid to the victims. “You can imagine what they walked into,” said Ardern. “They had to secure an environment for StJohn’s to be able to enter into, first.”

She also said that police response times to the incident and the time it took police to arrest the suspect were even faster than we have been told.

While Ardern said racism and extremism needed to be addressed in New Zealand and the rest of the world to stop another incident like this ever happening again, she repeatedly rejected suggestions that she has a duty to lead the world in the fight against the alt-right and extremism. Ardern says her first priority is New Zealand and caring for her people.

New Zealand journalist Toby Manhire urgently wants some answers from Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook’s role in the Christchurch tragedy. In an opinion piece – that first ran on the Spinoff – he writes:

“More than four days on, then, the $64 billion question (that’s how much Mr Zuckerberg is reportedly worth) is this: what do you have to say for yourself, Mark? Seems you’re busy, and instead have dispatched an underling to do the thoughts-and-prayers and “committed to countering hate speech and the threat of terrorism online”. Sitting here in New Zealand, that’s nowhere near good enough.”

You can read the piece in full here:

Ardern was asked several times about her personal response to the tragic events. She deflected a lot of the questions, seeming not to want to go into much detail on the subject.

Journalist: Prime Minister, yesterday in your speech you talked about you never thought you would be a voice for a nation’s grief. I’m wondering, we’ve seen you obviously at these news conferences, you present a very strong front. As a human being, as a mother, can you tell us maybe one moment of this since Friday that has just been very, very difficult for you, or you had difficulty dealing with it?

Ardern: I can’t tell you just one because, actually, there have been too many.

Journalist: Can you describe some of these moments that have just touched your heart for us?

Ardern: Everyone in New Zealand and internationally is reading the same stories I read. And my response is no different. Yes, I have a role I need to play. I feel the grief, I hear the grief. But I also have a duty of care to the people involved in this to also keep going. And so if the imam who stood at the front of a mosque and saw firsthand the loss of his worshippers in front of him can keep going, then I definitely can.

Later on in the press conference she was pressed again.

Journalist: Prime Minister, you mentioned that that at the high school this morning you were very sad. How are you fortifying yourself?

Ardern: As I said, if the imam who stood at the front and watched his friends and fellow worshippers continue on, then I absolutely can. I fortify myself by knowing I have a duty of care and a job to do.

Journalist: Is this the toughest thing you have ever had to face?

Ardern: Yes.

Journalist: On the issue of gun control, do you have anymore details on where that stands? Also, do you see whatever New Zealand has done as a blueprint to follow suit?

Ardern: “One thing I have to acknowledge is relative to other countries, not picking any one in particular, we have a large number of loopholes in our laws. Many New Zealanders would be astounded to know you can access military-style semiautomatics that you can here.

“My hope is that going forward, we will - we will - demonstrate what you can do if your starting point is similar to ours. We do have a road to travel though and I’ll be announcing further details very, very soon.”

Journalist: Can you give us a sense of what’s happening behind the scenes? What has to happen before Monday and then before the end of next week to get the changes you want pushed through?

Ardern: “Just to give you a flavour, even in terms of the preparation that needed to occur before we met as a cabinet, these attacks, this terrorist attack, occurred on Friday. By Monday, as a result of, literally, policy workers working through the night, we had proposals for cabinet.

“Decisions were made and now those same individuals are working incredibly hard to work through the detail of what is required to make that a reality.

“I reflect, again, Australia, when they experienced a tragedy, a mass shooting in the 1990s, it took them 12 days. We will do it in less but only through extraordinary effort.

Journalist: Prime Minister, the NRA is reported to be involved in coming into New Zealand to lobby and be of influence in the process of the conversation around gun control. Can you confirm it for one thing and do you have any concern?

Ardern: “No, I haven’t heard that, actually. But, do you know, I think - I’ve said from the very outset, that it is my belief that those who are currently the holders of both gun licences and guns, I believe they will be with us.

“I’ve already seen some commentary from individuals who are gun holders and gun - hold gun licences that very much indicate that they absolutely acknowledge something needs to change.

“Now, again, you know, there is legitimate gun use in New Zealand and we absolutely acknowledge that, but I would say almost all New Zealanders, except perhaps those who use them, will acknowledge that there isn’t and should not be a place for military-style semiautomatics.

Ardern was asked several questions about Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s comments, in which the Turkish president said people coming to Turkey with anti-Muslim views would be sent back in coffins like their grandfathers – a reference to the battle of Gallipoli in the first world war.

Ardern’s deputy prime minister Winston Peters is travelling to Turkey to discuss the subject with Turkey’s leaders.

Journalist: Is it appropriate for our Foreign Minister to be travelling at the time given the comments made by President Erdogan?

Ardern: As I’ve said, he is going there to set the record straight. That is an opportunity that he should take up. Now, we have to make sure that what is reflected is an accurate portrayal of New Zealand and New Zealanders. Indeed, of our Muslim community as well. And that is his intent.

Asked if she shared Australian prime minister Scott Morrison’s views that the comments were “deeply upsetting”, Ardern said: “As I said, our Deputy Prime Minister will be confronting those comments in Turkey. We had a delegation from the Turkish Government to bring a message of solidarity to New Zealand and to those affected by the attack.”

Later in the press conference a journalist returned to the subject, saying: “You must be offended that this is being used as a political tool in Turkey?”

She says:

I do not accept - I do not accept - that we will see the long-term change in our relationship. It is so deeply entrenched. They cared for our fallen. Hundreds and thousands of New Zealanders have made pilgrimages to that place as an acknowledgement of what ties and binds our countries. And so I reject the idea that we are losing that relationship, or will lose that relationship. But for now, you’ll appreciate that given that my Deputy Prime Minister is travelling there, that, actually, where this conversation will happen will be face-to-face.

And the press conference is over. We’ll have some key quotes from it shortly.

A journalist asks if this is the toughest thing Ardern has ever had to face.

She replies: “Yes.”

Jacinda Ardern says they need to ensure they create an environment where racist ideology cannot flourish and that is something she will put her mind to in coming months.

## 40, Jacinda Ardern calls for ‘ethical algorithms’ to help stop online radicalisation 

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/15/jacinda-ardern-calls-for-ethical-algorithms-to-help-stop-online-radicalisation

> New Zealand PM’s plea during Christchurch Call meeting comes two years after deadly mosque attack killed 51

Tech companies need to make more progress on algorithms that can drive social media users to become radicalised, New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said.

Along with France, New Zealand is leading a push to rid the world of extremist and terrorist content online – known as the Christchurch Call.

The initiative was launched after the deadly mosque attacks in Christchurch in March 2019 that killed 51 people and wounded dozens more, which was livestreamed by the attacker and stored online.

Ardern and her co-chair, France’s President Emmanuel Macron, hosted world leaders, tech company executives and affected communities – including Kiwi Muslim leaders – in a virtual Christchurch Call summit early on Saturday.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, were among those attending.

Ardern said the agreement, which brings together countries and tech companies to try to de-radicalise online spaces, had “such momentum”.

“We will not … prevent future atrocities such as what we experienced here on 15 March unless we work together,” she said.

The group has devised a new work programme for the next year and among its goals is changing how online content is delivered by tech companies.

A key finding of the royal commission into the Christchurch mosque attacks was that the man who carried them out, Australian Brenton Tarrant, who has since been jailed for life without parole, was radicalised on YouTube and other online spaces while viewing white-supremacist material.

YouTube’s algorithms link users to videos similar to those they are already watching, meaning viewers are recommended further extreme content. After her country’s experience, Ardern wants to see this change – and believes that it is happening.

“That is probably the biggest focus for the Call community over the next year,” she said.

“Let’s have that conversation around the ethical use of algorithms, and how they can use be used in a positive way and for positive interventions.

“When we look at the environment in which the terrorist for 15 March was radicalised, even in that period in those two years there has been significant change by many of the platforms.

“Algorithms are where many of us are looking to.”

YouTube chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, said on Twitter her company was continuing “to strengthen our policies, improve transparency, and restrict borderline content”.

After holding out on membership for two years, the US joined up as a supporter of the Call this week. China and Russia are not members.

The Christchurch Call has also developed a protocol which can intervene to stop the livestreaming of similar attacks.

This has occurred on two other occasions, during a 2019 shooting in Halle, Germany and a 2020 attack in Glendale, Arizona.

## 41, Christchurch attacks: producer resigns from film They Are Us as criticism grows

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/14/christchurch-attacks-producer-resigns-film-they-are-us-jacinda-ardern-criticism

> Jacinda Ardern says subject still feels ‘very raw’ amid ongoing accusations that film sidelines Muslim victims of 2019 massacre

A producer for a controversial Hollywood film depicting Jacinda Ardern’s response to the Christchurch terror attacks has resigned from the project after criticisms that it sidelined Muslim victims.

The premise of the film, They Are Us, has also been criticised by its proposed subject, New Zealand prime minister Ardern, who is slated to be played by Rose Byrne. Ardern said on Sunday it felt “very soon and very raw” for New Zealand, and that she was not an appropriate focus for a film about the 2019 mosque attacks. “There are plenty of stories from March 15 that could be told, but I don’t consider mine to be one of them,” she said. Ardern has reiterated that she has no involvement with the film.

The movie was announced by the Hollywood Reporter on Friday, and billed as an “inspirational story about the young leader’s response to the tragic events”.

It immediately came under fire for centring on the leadership of a white woman against the backdrop of the mass murder of 51 Muslims by a white supremacist. Many Muslim New Zealanders criticised the move as “exploitative”, “insensitive”, and “obscene”. A petition to shut down the film’s production has gained about 60,000 signatures over the past three days.

On Monday, New Zealand producer Philippa Campbell announced that she was resigning from the proposed production. “I’ve listened to the concerns raised over recent days and I have heard the strength of people’s views. I now agree that the events of March 15, 2019 are too raw for film at this time and do not wish to be involved with a project that is causing such distress,” she said in a statement released to media.

“The announcement was focused on film business, and did not take enough account of the political and human context of the story in this country. It’s the complexity of that context I’ve been reflecting on that has led me to this decision.”

When the film was announced on Friday, writer and community advocate Guled Mire told the Guardian that the premise was “completely insensitive”.

“The reality is many victims are struggling right now. They’re really still trying to pick up the pieces – financially, everything,” he said. “This tapped into that vulnerability to make the most out of the situation.”

The film will be directed and written by New Zealander Andrew Niccol, who wrote and directed Gattaca​. Niccol has not yet commented on the response to the film’s announcement. The Guardian has contacted the associated production companies for comment.

## 42, Christchurch attack: imam says he can't believe he is alive – as it happened

https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2019/mar/17/new-zealand-attack-christchurch-in-mourning-after-mosque-massacre-latest-updates

> Al Noor mosque’s imam said he was giving his sermon when the gunman began ‘shooting and shooting and shooting’
Latest: Ardern says ‘manifesto’ sent to office minutes before Christchurch massacre 

We’ll leave it there for now. Here’s a wrap of today’s events:

The imam of Al Noor mosque in Christchurch has spoken to media for the first time.

Gamal Fouda told reporters at the New Zealand Herald on Sunday that he still “can’t believe that I’m alive”, describing a scene of horror inside the mosque.

“I still can’t believe that I’m alive, he was shooting people and we were in there [hiding], we couldn’t even breathe from the smoke and the bullets flying everywhere.”

Fouda, who said he’d hardly slept since the attack, told the Herald he had just begun delivering his sermon when the shooting broke out.

He said one worshiper broke a window which allowed people on that side of the mosque to escape.

“But on the left side people they fall on each other and they piled on top of each other and he was standing and aiming at them and whenever he heard any noise coming from anywhere he would shoot towards it.”

Fouda said the gunman was “calmly” standing over people and “shooting and shooting and shooting and shooting”.

At one point during the attack the gunman returned to his vehicle to pick up another rifle. Fouda said those hiding inside the mosque had not known whether he had left.

“We were not able to see him [and] thank god he didn’t know where we are ... he came back and started shooting again [and] those people who came out from the hide he shoot them again ... because we didn’t know that he was coming back,” he said.

Alabi Lateef Zirullah, a prayer leader at the Linwood mosque, where the shooter attacked after leaving Al Noor, told the Herald the shooting began at about 1.55pm, with a man and wife gunned down outside.

“When I saw those Muslims shot dead I just told our brothers, ‘Go down! Go down! Somebody has just shot our brothers outside the masjid’,” Zirullah said.

“No one listened to me until unfortunately he came from behind and he shot one of our brothers [in] the head through the window. He saw him standing and shot him [through] the window. When glass got broken and the brother fell down, everyone realised to go down.”

A vigil is under way in Wellington where a huge crowd has gathered.

In Sydney, hundreds gathered in the pouring rain on Sunday calling for the end of Islamophobia in the country that produced Friday’s alleged killer.

Umbrellas went up outside the New Zealand consulate and the crowd spilled into what undercover nooks there were, as the speakers told the media and politicians to look at themselves. It had been raining for hours and it did not stop. There was a minute’s silence, before Dalya Ayoub, a Palestinian-New Zealander, spoke.

“We have been dehumanised for decades,” she said. “My daughters are constantly being reminded every day through the media to go back to where they came from. The Nazis have to go. White supremacy has to go. Not us.”

The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi said the focus should be on “our so-called mainstream politicians” like Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison, both former immigration ministers.

“I haven’t forgotten the years of race-baiting,” she said. “This is the time to be as loud as we can – we have to keep the media accountable and make sure politicians who do spread hate and bigotry are kicked out. They don’t deserve to be there.”

Police in Manchester in the UK arrested a man yesterday “on suspicion of sending malicious communications” in relation to the Christchurch shooting.

In a statement, Greater Manchester police said officers “became aware of a post on social media making reference and support for the terrible events in New Zealand”.“Police have made urgent enquiries and a man aged 24 from the Oldham area is now under arrest on suspicion of sending malicious communications,” police said. A police spokesman said: “This is a very difficult time for people. The events in New Zealand have reverberated around the world. Many people are in deep shock and are worried.“It is at times like this that, as a community, we stand together. Where the law permits and people cross the line, we will take robust action, which may include arrest and prosecution.”

Australia’s opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said a little earlier that rightwing politicians could not disown their hatred, racism and intolerance.

“You who want to practice in the name of free speech hate speech, you who hide behind liberty to practice evil, well you have created this swamp of hate,” he told reporters in Melbourne.

“You cannot disown what crawls out of your swamp.”

Shorten also commented on the 17-year-old boy who was arrested after he cracked an egg on the head of Senator Fraser Anning.

Video of the incident shows the senator reacting violently towards the boy. The teenager has since been released pending further inquiries.

Shorten said it was a silly thing to have done. “It doesn’t matter what rubbish the politician was spouting, you don’t want to give this foolish politician, this hurtful politician any sense of the moral high ground because he has none,” he said.

Facebook says that within 24 hours of Friday’s shooting the company had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack from its platform globally.

In the first 24 hours we removed 1.5 million videos of the attack globally, of which over 1.2 million were blocked at upload...

Bush has finished speaking.

Bush said tomorrow New Zealanders will see “a highly visible police presence on the streets, around your businesses, around your schools, and even in the air, right across the country. So you will feel safe to go about what you want to do tomorrow.”

Bush is asked about reports that concerns were raised about a gun club that the alleged shooter was a member of, with a hunter telling local media he reported his concerns to the police.

That commentary has come to us and we are exploring that. We will speak to those people. We would anyway, as part of the investigation. And anything that comes to light like that, we will be sharing.

He says he is not aware whether police were made aware of the concerns.

So we’re working through that as well. It’s important, when we know the answers to that, we share them with you.

New Zealand police commissioner Mike Bush is speaking to the media now. He says it was a “very quick response” to the attack.

I can tell you that within six minutes of police being called on 111, within six minutes, armed police staff were on the scene. Within 10 minutes members of our armed defenders squad were on the scene and within 36 minutes we had that mobile offender in our custody.

The leaders of both the Coalition and Labor in the Australian Senate – Mathias Cormann and Penny Wong – have confirmed they will move a joint censure motion against Senator Fraser Anning when the parliament resumes in April. Here’s the motion:

That the Senate:

(a) notes:

i. Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes...freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance”,

ii. religious persecution knows no geographic or sectarian boundaries and it afflicts religious believers of virtually every faith, on every continent,

iii. the strong statements made across the nation, led by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, that violence such as that witnessed in Christchurch is an affront on our common humanity,

iv. in the face of attacks designed to sow division, our responses must bring us together, recognising an attack on any religion is an attack on all religions and that we all share a responsibility to unite, condemn and defeat such an attack on our common values and way of life; and

(b) calls on all Australians to stand against hate and to publicly, and always, condemn actions and comments designed to incite fear and distrust

(c) endorses the statement of the Imam Hasan Centre following the attacks in Christchurch that: “It is times like this that we lose hope and doubt humanity, when people of faith come under attack in such a way, it shows us how low humanity can fall. However, it never ceases to amaze how far humanity can rise after such despicable events”

(d) censures Senator Anning for his inflammatory and divisive comments seeking to attribute blame to victims of a horrific crime and to vilify people on the basis of religion, which do not reflect the opinions of the Australian Senate or the Australian people.

The death toll from the Christchurch shooting rose to 50 this morning. Another 50 were injured and many still remain in hospital. Naaman Zhou and Sean Jacobs have worked on this list of the confirmed victims. It includes those victims who have been confirmed as killed, missing or injured – either by statements from family members, official organisations or both.

Haumaha and Marshall have finished speaking.

Haumaha confirms that two children died in the attack.

Haumaha says the victims ages ranged from “very close” to three-years-old to 77.

Marshall said victim postmortems began this morning, which includes the formal identification process. That confirms what we heard earlier from Jacinda Ardern that some of the bodies will be returned to families tonight.

The chief coroner, Deborah Marshall, is now speaking.

She said the coroner’s office was working “as quickly as possible” to return the bodies of victims to families as soon as possible.

We are very aware in the coronial service of the cultural issues surrounding this and are doing everything we can to manage the process in a culturally appropriate way.

## 43, Twitter failed to detect upload of Christchurch mosque terror attack videos

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/28/twitter-failed-to-detect-upload-of-christchurch-mosque-terror-attack-videos

> Footage was taken down only after the New Zealand government alerted Twitter, which had failed to pick up the content as harmful

Twitter has removed freshly uploaded footage of the Christchurch terror attack that was circulating on the platform, but only after the New Zealand government alerted the company, which had failed to recognise the content as harmful.

The video clips, filmed by the Australian white supremacist who murdered 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch in 2019, were uploaded by some Twitter users on Saturday, according to the office of the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern.

A spokesperson for the prime minister said Twitter’s automated reporting function didn’t pick up the content as harmful.

Other users reported the videos and the government separately raised it with Twitter, the office said. “Twitter advised us overnight that the clips have been taken down and said they would do a sweep for other instances.”

The mosque attack was livestreamed on multiple social media platforms and the terrorist’s manifesto published online.

Ardern launched the Christchurch Call after the attack, asking social media companies to counter online extremism and misinformation. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey had supported the initiative.

Speaking to media on Monday afternoon, Ardern said that while “time will tell” over Twitter’s commitment to removing harmful content, the company had advised the government it had not changed its view over its membership to the Christchurch Call community.

“We will continue to maintain our expectation that [Twitter does] everything they can on a day-to-day basis to remove that content but also to reduce terrorist content and violent extremist content online, as they’ve committed to,” Ardern said.

The Guardian attempted to contact Twitter for a response but received no reply.

Earlier this month, Ardern told a national security, disinformation and online extremism summit that Twitter has been deeply involved in the Christchurch Call “and – to date – been a really constructive partner”. But she said that partnership was in “unknown territory” after Elon Musk’s takeover of the company.

Ardern urged Musk – the world’s richest man and self-described free speech absolutist – to “stick strongly to the principle of transparency”, adding that social media platforms like Twitter “can be a force for democracy, a force for connection and for good. But also, if misused, they can do a huge amount of harm.”

Writing for the Conversation, Markus Luczak-Roesch, an Associate Professor in Information Systems at Victoria University of Wellington, said Musk’s takeover has been disruptive to the Christchurch Call, with the entire Twitter team the government was planning to work with gone after lay-offs.

Thousands of content moderators, as well as the human rights teams, have been laid off since Musk’s takeover, and the platform has been struggling to police harmful content, including the proliferation of misinformation accounts and racist tweets in the lead up to the World Cup.

In a recent post to Twitter, Musk told his 119 million followers that hate speech was down by a third from its pre-spike levels in October and produced a chart. No further details were provided.

## 44, Christchurch shooting: security agencies were focused on Islamist terror, inquiry finds

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/08/christchurch-shooting-new-zealand-security-agencies-were-focused-on-islamist-terror-inquiry-finds

> New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern apologises for police and security failings but says they would not have stopped the attack

New Zealand’s security agencies were “almost exclusively” focused on the threat from Islamist terrorism at the time of the 2019 Christchurch shooting, in which a gunman shot dead 51 Muslim worshippers, an inquiry into the country’s worst peacetime massacre has found.

The landmark Christchurch royal commission report, which was released on Tuesday after 20 months of consultation, also revealed police failed to enforce proper checks on firearm licences.

The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, apologised for the failings but noted: “The commission made no findings that these issues would have stopped the attack.”

“Going forward, we need to ensure an adequate focus of resources on the range of threats New Zealand faces and enhance our security and intelligence, and social cohesion work,” she said. “You and others have made New Zealand your home. You, and every New Zealander, deserve a system that does its best to keep you safe.”

Ardern said she would accept all of the 44 recommendations contained in the 792-page document.

Initial measures to be taken by the government include the establishment of a ministry of ethnic communities, improvements to help police identify and manage hate crime and be more responsive to victims, improvements to hate-speech laws and research on extremism, and the creation of an early intervention programme for people showing early signs of radicalisation.

More time would be needed to develop a response to some of the recommendations, she said.

The Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand (IWCNZ) said in a statement that justice had not been served by the inquiry, saying it was severely restricted by its terms of reference and suffered from a lack of transparency.

“There are multiple areas of evidence that have not been investigated, and questions raised by IWCNZ have been ignored,” it said. “We find it concerning that the commissioners found systemic failures and an inappropriate concentration of resources towards Islamic terrorism, and yet state that these would not have made a difference to the terrorist being detected prior to the event.”

On 15 March 2019, an Australian gunman, Brenton Tarrant, shot dead 51 worshippers during Friday prayers at two mosques in the city of Christchurch. The attacks were the largest mass shooting in New Zealand’s history and the first act of terrorism in decades, prompting an outpouring of grief in the normally peaceful nation, and calls from many in the Muslim community to confront what they said had been a rising tide of white supremacist threats.

Prior to the attack the gunman posted multiple troubling references online, was able to legally obtain a gun licence, and carried out reconnaissance missions to both mosques.

On Tuesday, it was reported the gunman had accidentally shot himself while cleaning a firearm months before the attack, and required treatment in Dunedin for bullet fragments in his eye and leg. At the time, there was no mandatory legislation regarding the reporting of gunshot wounds.

In the wake of the attack, Ardern commissioned the inquiry into why and how the massacre took place, and whether it could have been prevented.

Andrew Little, the minister in charge of the country’s spy agencies, has been given the job of coordinating implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations.

One factor the report identified was the secrecy surrounding counter-terrorism approaches by successive governments. “One reason for this was to avoid stigmatising Muslims. But had such a strategy been shared with the public and also incorporated a ‘see something, say something’ policy, it is possible that aspects of the individual’s planning may … have been reported,” the report said

“With the benefit of hindsight, such reporting would have provided the best chance of disrupting the terrorist attack.”

Ardern noted that despite reports back to the 1990s identifying the firearms control system as lax, significant changes were not made until after the attack.

The police commissioner, Andrew Coster, said on Tuesday legislative changes this month will clarify the criteria for determining whether someone was fit to own a firearm, including specifying criminal convictions that disqualify them.

New Zealand’s Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS) chief, Rebecca Kitteridge, acknowledged there was insufficient focus on right-wing extremists until 2018 but said it was a misconception that the Muslim community was specifically targeted. It was a small agency and only a small number of individuals were monitored, she said.

The NZSIS needed to explain its role to the public better, said Kitteridge, who said she was working on building a better relationship with the Muslim community.

Ardern said no individual was found in the report to be at fault and no one would lose their job. Despite the inappropriate focus on Islamist extremism, the report did not conclude the security agencies were Islamophobic.

After the report’s release, families affected by the attacks supported the recommendations and said they would work together to make sure they were implemented.

Rashid Omar, who lost his son in the attack, welcomed the report but called for more accountability. “Though the report brought hard memories, it answers some of those questions, however not all,” he told Stuff. “The affected families, survivors, and witnesses have not had their questions answered, particularly the question of accountability.” He raised concern about the redacted names on the final report.

Muslim groups have repeatedly said their warnings about threats from white supremacists before the attack had been ignored.

The Islamic community told the inquiry that it knew it was “vulnerable” to a terror attack, and that security forces had wrongly focused on terrorism committed by Muslim extremists.

The opposition National party pledged to work with the government on the reforms called for in the report, which identified years of inaction by Labour and National governments. Party leader Judith Collins said: “In principle, we support strengthening the role of our security and intelligence agencies but we must tread carefully to safeguard New Zealanders’ rights and liberties.”

In August the killer, who livestreamed the massacre on Facebook and published an extremist manifesto online detailing his anti-Islamic views, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The inquiry took place behind closed doors and interviewed everyone from top security officials to survivors, current and former prime ministers and Tarrant.

During the course of the inquiry, more than 400 meetings were held, 340 non-disclosure orders were made, 73,500 pages of evidence and submissions were analysed and 217 public sector agencies were asked to provide information.

More than 1,100 people wrote formal submissions.

## 45, Christchurch shooting: what we know so far

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/new-zealand-shooting-what-we-know-so-far

> One man charged with murder after 50 killed at two mosques in the city of Christchurch 

Fifty people are confirmed dead after Friday’s shootings at two mosques in Christchurch in New Zealand’s South Island. Forty-two people died at Al Noor mosque and seven at Linwood mosque. Another victim died later at hospital.

As of Sunday, 34 people remained in hospital, including a four-year-old girl who is in a critical condition.

A 28-year-old Australian man named Brenton Tarrant appeared in court in Christchurch on Saturday charged with murder. No application for bail was made and he is due to appear in court again on 5 April.

The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said the suspect planned to continue his attack and had two other firearms in his vehicle. She said the weapons used in the attack were modified.

Tarrant remains the only person charged in relation to the attacks. A woman apprehended at the scene was released without charge. Another 18-year-old man arrested in a vehicle has been charged with firearm offences unrelated to the terrorist attack.

New Zealand’s cabinet meets on Monday to discuss changing gun laws after it emerged the main suspect held a firearms licence and said he had been legally stockpiling weapons since 2017. Ardern said he was carrying five firearms at the time of the attacks, including two semi-automatic weapons and two shotguns.

The attorney general, David Parker, said the government would ban semi-automatic rifles, warning of a global rise in extremism. “There is a dimming of enlightenment in many parts of the world,” he is quoted as saying by the New Zealand Herald.

Pakistan, Turkey, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia have all said their citizens were affected in the attack. Some names have begun to emerge, including a three-year-old boy who was at Al Noor mosque with his father and older brother.

The Queen, Theresa May, Pope Francis, Donald Trump and other world leaders expressed sorrow, shock and anger.

The attack, launched during Friday prayers when both mosques were packed, was livestreamed via a camera strapped to the perpetrator. Horrific images of bloodshed and people desperately trying to evade the gunman were copied and shared on social media sites including YouTube. Facebook has said it removed 1.5m videos of the attack in the first 24 hours.

Ardern spoke of the attacker’s motivation, saying the victims might include refugees and migrants. “They are us,” she said, before saying the perpetrator “has no place in New Zealand”.

Worshippers inside one of the mosques have spoken of their terror as the gunman filmed his rampage.

Bangladesh’s cricket team “just escaped” after shots were fired near to where the team was due to play their final Test match of their New Zealand tour. They sheltered in the dressing rooms at Hagley Oval before being taken to their hotel. The opening batsman, Tamim Iqbal, described the experience as “frightening”.

US mosques went on high alert after the attack, with authorities in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles announcing plans to ramp up police presence around local mosques where many worshippers were headed for Friday prayers.

## 46, New Zealand government under fire after shelving Christchurch hate speech reforms

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/09/new-zealand-government-under-fire-after-shelving-christchurch-hate-speech-reforms

> Prime minister Chris Hipkins has said his government will refocus on economic issues, after dropping laws put forward after terror attack

New Zealand’s government has come under fire for withdrawing proposed hate speech laws – introduced after the mosque terror attacks in Christchurch – in favour of “refocusing on the economy”.

The prime minister, Chris Hipkins, announced on Wednesday that the government would halt efforts on the hate speech laws, as part of a wider effort to “refocus” the government on “bread and butter” economic issues in the wake of Jacinda Ardern’s resignation and with an election on the horizon.

The laws, which toughened the response to hate speech against minority groups, were put forward as a result of recommendations from the royal commission of inquiry into the Christchurch attacks, in which a white supremacist gunman killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques. Progressive and Islamic groups have criticised their delay, saying they leave minority groups at risk.

Aliya Danzeisen, national coordinator of the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand, said in a statement that it had been more than two years since the royal commission issued its report, and Muslim women and children had “faced an onslaught of hatred”.

“How many more people need to suffer from hate and for how long before our legislators will have the courage to do what is right?” Danzeisen said. “There is no more time or consideration needed.”

First proposed in 2021, the reforms had proven controversial, with the government struggling at times to define what kind of speech would reach the threshold for prosecution. They were criticised by progressive groups for not offering broad enough protections to women, LGBTQI, and disability communities, and by others for a lack of clarity or for encroaching on freedom of speech.

Hipkins said the hate speech laws were highly contentious and absorbing government attention when it needed to focus on economic issues.

“There are some very legitimate issues that have been raised, but I don’t want to have them mired in a debate which is going nowhere,” he said.

Chief human rights commissioner Paul Hunt said the government had “given way to often mis-informed and opportunistic political debate … when we should have been coming together as a society to do all we can to ensure such horrific acts of terror never happen again.”

The Green party has criticised the move, with human rights spokesperson Golriz Ghahraman saying she feels “the heartbreak and disappointment of the communities including [Christchurch] victims”.

“An inability to report hate speech means our institutions can’t monitor that risk,” she said, adding that it would “make our communities unsafe”.

New Zealand’s current hate speech laws cover race, but not gender, sexuality, or religion. The proposed laws had initially increased protections for all of those groups, but were then watered down to cover only religion. They will now be abandoned in their current form until after the election.

> As the first anniversary of the atrocity that shocked New Zealand looms, victims struggle with enduring trauma – but also carry a sense of hope

At first, Hisham al Zarzour couldn’t remember what had happened. Later, he tried to forget. Lying beneath the bodies of other worshippers at Al Noor mosque in Christchurch last March as a gunman fired again and again, he prayed that Allah would send him back to Syria to die.

There, war had been a way of life. Chaos became normal. But the violence in peaceful New Zealand came just seven months after the sleepy, leafy city had become his home. That something so barbaric could happen in his place of refuge was unbearable.

“All of these 10 minutes [of the attack] I was praying, ‘Please, I need to go to the war. I need to go to the jail in Syria to die. The rubbish there, it’s better than this situation.’”

In the week before the attack’s first anniversary on 15 March, the Guardian visited Christchurch, where bereaved families and survivors of the shooting are bracing themselves for renewed interest as the global spotlight swings back to the city. Many in the Muslim community are dreading the attention while they still come to terms with new lives and realities, their bodies and prospects and families forever changed by the gunman’s assault.

“To be honest I felt mentally, after the mosque attack, better than now,” al Zarzour says. Last March, he had carpooled to Al Noor with his closest friend in New Zealand, a fellow Syrian, Khaled Mustafa. He couldn’t remember what they’d spoken about.

After the shooting, al Zarzour emerged, badly wounded, from beneath the bodies of two men. Mustafa’s face was the first he saw. He had died along with his son Hamza, 16, and 42 others in the nation’s worst peacetime massacre.

“My behaviour now is not quite right,” al Zarzour says. He is a slight, bearded man with huge, dark eyes. He talks to the Guardian at his home while his two primary school-aged children watch cartoons and the third, a toddler, scales the kitchen cabinets like a monkey, his wife chasing her to and fro.

“Sometimes I think everything is weird,” he says. “I’m trying to make the situation stable for my family.”

The attacks on Al Noor and Linwood mosques shattered an illusion of innocence and security in peaceful, friendly New Zealand, a country that had never experienced a major terrorist attack or been forced to confront acts of Islamophobia or white supremacy as other Western countries had.

The outpouring of grief and love from the country’s inhabitants – and exhortations to unity from the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, who announced six days after the shooting that she would ban most semiautomatic weapons – thrust New Zealand onto the world stage. Almost a year on, the galvanising phrase “they are us” uttered by Ardern in the wake of the attacks feels less certain; an inquiry due to conclude in April is seeking answers about whether state actors might have failed to prevent the attack, and the man accused of committing it – an Australian, charged with murder, attempted murder and terrorism – faces a lengthy and high-profile trial in June.

Al Zarzour does not sleep regularly, often drifting off at 6am to wake from nightmares at half-hour intervals. The bullet wounds to his legs have caused chronic nerve pain.

At first, he watched over and over the footage the gunman allegedly broadcast live on Facebook, trying to understand what had happened; a compulsion shared with other survivors of the attack. He tries not to watch the video any more.

“To be honest, I take 600 milligrams of depression medicine every day to forget that,” he says. “But I can’t.”

Eight kilometres away, in a quiet residential part of the city, Maysoon Salama wrestles with the new security gate at An Nur, the Muslim childcare centre she runs with her husband, Mohammad Alayan. “I don’t even know if I can work it out tomorrow to open it for people,” she says, only half-joking.

Security is heightened now. Before the mosque attack, the centre was targeted for harassment and abuse – once, someone painted in blood on her car – but the police never took action, she says. Five children who attend the school lost parents in the attack, and a four-year-old pupil was shot and partially blinded by the gunman. Many other parents were injured and traumatised.

Salama returned to work nursing her own grief. Her son, Atta Elayyan, 33, died in the attack, while her husband was badly injured. Elayyan, a brilliant app developer, sportsman, husband and father to Aya, aged two, was shot and killed in Al Noor. His father is struggling with suspected lead poisoning from his wounds, and Salama worries. He is tired and losing weight, she says.

As the government and city council prepare to hold a national memorial service for the victims at a park near Al Noor on the anniversary next week, Salama feels a sense of unease. “We know that it’s coming from good intentions,” she says of the memorial service. “The government want to do something, and for those of us who are participating [it’s] basically to acknowledge these efforts.

“But for us, [is it] like we want this? We don’t. [Is it] really helping much? It’s not. In fact, it’s triggering a lot of things. And it’s putting a lot of pressure on us.”

One-year anniversaries are a Western concept, many in the Muslim community say. Their beliefs require a three-day mourning period before the bereaved move on, keeping their loved one alive through memory. Elayyan’s acts of goodness are never far from his mother’s mind, stories that paint a picture of a man so virtuous as to be implausible – except that friends, colleagues and acquaintances all say the same things.

“He has a very, very soft heart and he is very selfless,” Salama says. “Any little thing, any little stress for anybody, you will find that he is also distressed and he wants to do whatever he can do to help that person, whether it’s financial, whether it’s advice, whether it’s just talking or anything.

“Even the cat …” she says, recounting a story of her son’s fumbling but well-intentioned efforts to care for the family’s pet when it was bitten by another cat (he had lovingly fashioned a cone for the animal’s neck which he had then accidentally taped to its fur). “You feel he wouldn’t really leave anybody who needs help without.”

Salama has resisted asking others at the mosque that day for details of her son’s final moments. But another worshipper – an elderly man – told her after the attack that when the gunfire turned in the man’s direction, Elayyan had stepped in front of him.

“I am a miracle,” says Temel Atacocugu. When the gunman stormed Al Noor he was shot nine times, once in the face. A metal and porcelain bridge in his mouth – a 13-year-old piece of dentistry - was the only thing that prevented the bullet travelling into his brain.

“If I [had] normal teeth, everybody – you know, dentist, surgeon, everyone – said that’s going to kill me,” he says.

Atacocugu – originally from Turkey and now a New Zealand citizen – is a softly-spoken, genial man. But like many of those wounded or bereaved in the attacks, he faces a life forever changed, a punishing schedule of surgeries and an ongoing battle with his mental health.

When Atacocugu visits Al Noor these days, he sits facing the door. “If something happens, at least I can hide,” he says. Flashbacks to the attack strike often, and sleep is possible only with medication. Before the shootings, he loved playing and watching sports; never sat still.

Now, he battles depression and physical pain that at times bar him from leaving the house; instead, he watches TV on his couch. He is learning to reconcile the joy of being alive with the horror of what he saw a year ago.

Atacocugu will attend the memorial “with very mixed feelings”.

A month after the attacks, worshippers returned in throngs to Al Noor for Friday prayers, past armed police at the gates. Reminders of what had happened were inescapable. Worshippers prayed on plastic-coated underlay that slid underfoot; the mosque’s carpet had been removed by police and a replacement had yet to arrive.

Outside, a police truck waited. After that week’s jumu’ah – the Friday prayer service – worshippers could search it for belongings they had dropped during the mayhem. Among the items were shoes, spectacles and wallets whose owners would never return to claim them.

Eleven months on, new carpet has been laid, and Feroze Ditta walks through the mosque’s front doors and down its long hallway just as he did on 15 March last year. As he did that day, he takes a seat in the mosque’s small office. Most of the friends who sat around the table with him a year ago are gone.

They had talked about ordinary things. “We said, ‘All right, see you next Friday,’” he recalls. Then the men shook hands and went in for prayers.

“When I first came back after that day it was hard,” Ditta says of returning to the mosque months after the attacks. “It took me a lot of courage to get up and walk through those doors.”

He had been lucky and unlucky; two bullets cut through his calf, leaving Ditta – a contractor for a trucking company - out of work and facing a career change in his early 50s. But he had survived.

To his surprise, upon his return he found himself thrust into a leadership role as the mosque’s secretary, a busy job. Its membership has grown “15-20%” since the attacks and he manages a flurry of correspondence. Every time a white supremacist attacks Muslims anywhere in the world, people want to know what his community thinks.

“What I worry about is after the cameras have gone, the media have gone, and support services like Victim Support, ACC, MSD, when they pull back, what the result of that would be on people,” he says, referring to the government agencies providing financial and emotional aid to the bereaved and survivors.

Christchurch is a city still visibly healing from another dark day, a deadly earthquake that struck on 22 February 2011, killing 185 people and razing the central business district to the ground. The quake put pressure on local mental health services, which still groan under the weight of demand.

Down by the grassy banks of the Avon River that flows through the city centre is a memorial for the earthquakes; smooth, inscribed stone that tourists stop to read. Nine years on, insurance claims for ruined homes remain fraught and schools are responding to earthquake-related trauma in students who were not even born when the 2011 shake happened.

No decision has been made yet on an official memorial for the mosque attacks; some in the community worry they will be criticised for taking attention away from the long shadow of the earthquakes. They read comments on social media suggesting it is time the Muslim community stopped talking about Christchurch. Some don’t want to make trouble, so they have.

“We have been put in a difficult situation, because the minute there is publicity about the memorial thing, you know, some people started also writing comments or, ‘Oh, look, that memorial for the Muslims is this big event, and now the earthquake is forgotten’,” Salama says. “We’re being put in the spotlight again against our will. We’re not the ones who asked for it.”

But many, including Salama, are defiant too. “You know, he made us more faithful to our religion,” she says of the gunman. “He made us more determined to not to be victimised and to keep going and to even spread the beauty of Islam everywhere. If he wanted to finish us, he failed miserably. And a lot of good things have happened.”

On a hillside cloaked in mist at Pony Point, south-east of the city – overlooking glass-flat sea and small boats dotted across Cass Bay – an unofficial memorial is quietly growing. There, 51 fledgling native trees are taking root, one for each of those who died, and are still clad in protective plastic. “Humanity”, reads a small plaque. “When you sow a seed of kindness and empathy, it grows into 51 trees of hope and love.”



## 48, Censor bans 'manifesto' of Christchurch mosque shooter

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/24/censor-bans-manifesto-of-christchurch-mosque-shooter

> David Shanks says document ‘deliberately constructed to inspire murder and terrorism’, as more than 1,000 New Zealanders register to hand in guns

New Zealand’s chief censor has banned a document shared by the man allegedly responsible for killing 50 people in two Christchurch mosques.

Meanwhile, more than 1,000 people so far have opted to hand in their weapons following a ban on assault rifles and military-style semi-automatics (MSSAs).

David Shanks, the chief censor, officially classed the so-called manifesto as “objectionable” and told anyone in possession of it to destroy it.

“There is an important distinction to be made between ‘hate speech,’ which may be rejected by many right-thinking people, but which is legal to express, and this type of publication, which is deliberately constructed to inspire further murder and terrorism,” Shanks said in making his decision.

He said the document “crosses the line” by promoting, encouraging and justifying acts of murder and terrorist violence against identified groups of people.

“New Zealanders can all play a part in denying those who exhort hatred, killing and terror,” Shanks said. “Do not support the murderous objectives of its author by republishing or distributing it.”

The document, which lays out the alleged murderer’s views, was posted on various social media platforms and was also sent to media outlets and the office of the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, minutes before the attack began.

Shanks told members of the public to delete any copies of the document, along with posts or links to it.

Authorities have also banned video of the fatal shootings, including edited footage and still images.

Ardern on Monday announced a ban on firearms that extends to related parts used to convert guns into MSSAs, and all high-capacity magazines. Police say they are receiving hundreds of calls a day about the ban with more than 1,000 people registering to hand their firearms in.

Corrections minister Kelvin Davis was one among thousands who surrendered a semi-automatic rifle, which he used for hunting.

The total number of firearms in New Zealand is estimated to be about 1.2m to 1.5m for a country with 245,000 firearms licences. Military-style semi-automatics can cost from $200 to more than $10,000 and there are at least 15,000 registered in New Zealand, according to police figures.

The government has also put in place a gun buyback scheme, expected to cost between $100m and $200m.

Tensions are still high across the country with concertgoers at a Wellington music festival on Saturday being evacuated for 20 minutes. Police led the action after they identified a man with suspected rightwing tattoos acting suspiciously. They later called it an “innocent misunderstanding” and the concert went on.

On Sunday evening more than 10,000 people are expected to turn out in Christchurch for a vigil to remember those who lost their lives. It will feature prayers from the local Imam, as well as songs and haka.

The opposition National party leader Simon Bridges has called for a royal commission into New Zealand’s security and intelligence agencies.

“A royal commission is the only suitable level of inquiry to ensure this is investigated thoroughly and independently. We need to understand whether this could have been prevented. It will need to ask hard questions about whether our security and intelligence agencies had their focus in the right places,” he said.

“Our security risk has now changed and New Zealanders need to be kept safe. The royal commission should look at the past, and parliament should get on with actions for the future.”

A national remembrance service for the victims of the Christchurch terrorist attack, and all those affected by it, will be held at 10am on Friday 29 March, Ardern announced on Sunday.

The service will be held in Christchurch in Hagley Park and will be jointly led by the government of New Zealand, the city of Christchurch, Ngāi Tahu and the Muslim community.

Considerations are being given to simultaneously broadcasting the service to events in Auckland, Wellington and Dunedin and providing links for events in other towns and cities.

“The national remembrance service provides an opportunity for Cantabrians, New Zealanders and people all around the world to come together as one to honour the victims of the terrorist attack,” Ardern said.

“In the week since the unprecedented terror attack there has been an outpouring of grief and love in our country. The service will be a chance to once again show that New Zealanders are compassionate, inclusive and diverse, and that we will protect those values.

“The terrorist attack has been significant for many countries. We anticipate international guests and visitors will want to attend and to join us in our sorrow and support for the victims and their families.”

Meanwhile 15,000 people have signed a petition campaigning for Ardern to be awarded the Nobel peace prize for leadership in the wake of the attack.

Facebook, where the live footage was streamed to as the attack unfolded, has also promised changes to its platform. It took 29 minutes to detect the livestreamed video, which was eight minutes longer than it took police to arrest the gunman. About 1.3m copies of the video were blocked from Facebook but 300,000 copies were published and shared.

Facebook spokesman Simon Dilner told Radio New Zealand that it could have done a better job and was prepared for regulatory action.

“Of course we hate it when bad people, including this attacker … use our service in this way.”

Dilner said the whole company was saddened by the attack and their “hearts are with New Zealand”.

“Of course people are looking to figure out, ‘How can we stop this ever happening again,’ and we know we play a part in that … We’re focused on the safety of people in New Zealand, we’re focused on the investigation.”

Several companies, including the ANZ and ASB banks, have stopped advertising on Facebook after the company was widely condemned by the public.

## 49, New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern addresses Harvard on gun control and democracy

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/27/jacinda-ardern-wows-harvard-with-new-zealands-lesson-on-gun-control-and-democracy

> Ardern warns against ‘scourge of online disinformation’, and wins standing ovation for crackdown on weapons

Jacinda Ardern has spoken out against the online “scourge of disinformation” in an address at Harvard University, in which she also won standing ovations for her government’s gun control laws, diversity and decriminalisation of abortion.

The New Zealand prime minister was honoured by the American university , making the annual commencement address to more than a thousand students on Thursday from the same stage as figures such as Winston Churchill, Angela Merkel, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey.

Ardern’s address was built around the need for democratic systems and informed debate, invoking the same plea from the late Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto, who underscored the “fragility” of democracy in her own address to the university in 1989.

But, with the United States reeling from the Texas school massacre and paralysed over how to stop the violence, she won loud cheers and a standing ovation when she spoke about how her government cracked down on gun ownership in the wake of the 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks.

“We knew we needed significant gun reform, and so that is what we did,” she said. “But we also knew that if we wanted genuine solutions to the issue of violent extremism online, it would take government, civil society and the tech companies themselves to change the landscape.”

Developing her theme of trying to combat online extremists such as the perpetrator of the Christchurch attacks, Ardern tied the problem to the defence of democracy.

“This imperfect but precious way that we organise ourselves, that has been created to give equal voice to the weak and to the strong, that is designed to help drive consensus – it is fragile,” Ardern said.

“For years it feels as though we have assumed that the fragility of democracy was determined by duration.

“That somehow the strength of your democracy was like a marriage; the longer you’d been in it, the more likely it was to stick. “But that takes so much for granted.”

Ardern took aim at online disinformation and called on tech companies to do more to stop the online spread of conspiracy theories.

“The time has come for social media companies and other online providers to recognise their power and to act on it,” she said.

She finished her speech with a call for kindness, and to bridge differences with others. “What we do as individuals in these spaces matters too ... we are the richer for our difference, and poorer for our division,” she said.

Ardern received cheers when she told the assembled throng that New Zealand’s parliament was 50% women, almost 20% Maori, and her deputy was “a proud gay man sitting among several other rainbow parliamentarians”. She was applauded after law changes including decriminalising abortion, outlawing most assault weapons, and banning ‘conversion therapy’.

As is tradition for commencement speakers, Ardern was also given an honorary degree, in her case a doctorate of law.

> The New Zealand prime minister was lauded for her handling of the Christchurch massacre and climate issues. But she faces a stiff test to meet pledges on affordable housing and Māori rights

Jacinda Ardern sets September election date


Handling of Christchurch massacre

Ardern’s response to the terrorist attack on two Christchurch mosques that killed 51 people was praised around the world; her face was painted onto buildings, she became a household name in the Muslim world, and she was discussed as a potential winner of the Nobel peace prize.

Her words urging compassion and peace, and reassuring the Muslim communities targeted in the shootings, seemed to stand in stark contrast to anti-immigrant sentiment in other western nations. Six days after the attacks, Ardern pledged to outlaw most semiautomatic weapons in New Zealand and it was made into law less than a month after the attacks, voted for by every New Zealand parliamentarian bar one.

It was the standout moment of her prime ministership. But survivors and the wider Muslim community are facing ongoing physical, financial, mental health, and safety issues and the nation faces a lengthy trial for the man accused of the attacks and an inquiry into whether they could have been prevented. So Ardern may be forced to address some of the ugliest aspects of the 15 March attacks ahead of this year’s election.

The zero carbon bill

The government’s push to enshrine its Paris climate change targets into law boasted cross-party support – the centre-right, opposition National party voted for it – and a plan to tax farmers for their emissions from 2025, or earlier if they are not making progress on reductions. The climate change minister and Green party co-leader, James Shaw, was the policy’s architect. But Ardern made headlines for decrying a lack of global action on climate change in speeches at the United Nations and at the Pacific Islands Forum, which was attended by many of the leaders whose island nations are most at risk from rising sea levels.

Banning plastic bags

Ardern has said the greatest number of letters she received from children early in her time as prime minister urged her to ban plastic bags. She did, and the government is enacting its next phase of its war on single-use plastic, including impending bans on meat trays, cups and takeaway food containers.

Sexual and domestic violence laws

In 2018, a new law brought by , the Green party allowed victims of domestic violence to take 10 days of paid leave from work, on top of their regular holiday entitlements. The government passed a law making strangulation a separate offence to regular assault. It also pledged to make solutions to family violence holistic, multi-agency responses.

New Zealand history and climate change education

All 11-14 years olds will have the opportunity to learn about climate change activism and eco-anxiety, among other things, after an optional curriculum was introduced this month. The government also won plaudits for pledging New Zealand history would be compulsory in schools by 2022. Māori and colonial history is not widely known by New Zealanders. Ardern also made global headlines for pledging that her daughter, Neve, would learn te reo Māori, the Indigenous language – and one of the country’s official languages.

Action on refugees

New Zealand’s refugee quota will increase to 1,500 from 1,000 in 2020, Ardern announced in 2018. The government in 2019 reversed a rule that restricted refugees from Middle Eastern and African nations from settling in New Zealand unless they could prove family connections to the country, something that was difficult to do and which policy advocates described as racist.

Failing to fire on KiwiBuild

Stories about a rising tide of homelessness and families sleeping in cars flooded the media ahead of the 2017 election. The suggestion by Labour that nine years of a neoliberal, National-led government had made housing unaffordable for first-time buyers and some of New Zealand’s most vulnerable people was a central part of Ardern’s campaign.

But two and a half years on, its flagship KiwiBuild policy – a plan to build 100,000 new houses in 10 years, in collaboration with the private sector – has been “reset” with new goals after failing to generate the number of new houses the government promised, and with a new minister in charge.

Labour must also face a social housing waiting list that has reached new peaks, unaffordable rents in the major cities, and the criticism by some analysts that it should have implemented a capital gains tax to cool off the market for first home buyers.

On housing, Labour has been hobbled by New Zealand’s three-year election cycle: faced with a huge shortfall in the number of houses, it was never going to solve the problem between 2017 and 2020. But most commentators agree the government massively over-promised and under-delivered.

Labour party sex scandal

Ardern has been seen as an inspiration for women worldwide so it was a blow to her party’s image when Labour was rocked by sexual assault allegations from a party member against a staffer. The party’s president resigned over the scandal. An independent lawyer’s report months later found “insufficient evidence” against the staffer. Labour had earlier faced a scandal when young attendees at a camp for its youth wing alleged sexual misconduct and assault by a fellow attendee.

Oranga Tamariki’s record with Māori children

A video of social workers’ attempts to take a newborn baby from his mother stoked outrage in New Zealand, and led to calls for the social work agency Oranga Tamariki to be disbanded. Six out of 10 children in care are Māori. An inquiry found major blunders were made in the case. Ardern and Tracey Martin, the minister for children, were criticised for saying they would not watch the video that generated the outcry.

Standoff at Ihumātao site

Ardern was in 2019 criticised for inaction over a Māori land occupation at Ihumātao, where groups within the same iwi, or tribe, are conflicted over the sale of ancestral land to property developers. Her government has since been involved in attempting to help broker a solution to end the standoff although no announcement has been made yet.

Tying new policy to wellbeing

The government generated global headlines when it announced its first wellbeing budget in 2019, with all new spending proposals intended to be collaborative between agencies and tied to wellbeing markers. The government will be scrutinised at 2020’s budget about whether it results in more compassionate and life-improving policy. Watch out, too, for the government’s record on child poverty being tested in an election year: it is an issue dear to Ardern’s heart, and one on which advocates, including the children’s commissioner, have criticised her progress to date.

The success of pledges on mental health

An at times chaotic mental health system, and high suicide rate were behind pledges by Ardern ahead of the 2017 election that she would pay proper attention to mental health if she became the prime minister. A major inquiry into mental health made 40 recommendations for change, and the government accepted 38 of them; in 2020, Ardern will be expected to deliver solutions for a cash-strapped and overworked sector struggling to meet demand.

## 51, Christchurch attack inquiry: the key findings and recommendations

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/08/christchurch-attack-inquiry-the-key-findings-and-recommendations

> Royal commission into mosque shootings took 20 months to compile a nearly 800-page report

Christchurch shooting: security agencies were focused on Islamist terror, inquiry finds 


Here is what we know about the report so far:

The report found New Zealand’s security agencies were “almost exclusively” focused on the threat from Islamist terrorism, and the police had failed to enforce proper checks on firearm licenses. The royal commission findings said that despite the shortcomings, there were no failings within government agencies that would have alerted them to the imminent attack by the white supremacist, who was sentenced to life without parole in August.

Secrecy about counter-terrorism approaches by successive governments had consequences, the report said: “One reason for this was to avoid stigmatising Muslims. But had such a strategy been shared with the public and also incorporated a ‘see something, say something policy’, it is possible that aspects of the individual’s planning may … have been reported.”

Other factors involved in failure to detect the attack included: the terrorist’s “operational security”; the laws the security agencies work with; and the limited capability and capacity of the agencies.

The report found the gunman was treated in hospital months before the attack after accidentally shooting himself, leaving fragments in one eye and leg. Medical staff did not report the wounds to police, because there was no mandatory legislation requiring it.

The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, apologised for “failings” by the security and intelligence agencies and within the firearms licensing system but said they could not have prevented the attack.

The royal commission noted the attack “was driven by an extreme right-wing Islamophobic ideology. Its purpose was to promote chaos and disharmony in New Zealand.”

The report said “this purpose failed”, and “in the days, weeks and months that followed, New Zealanders united around those affected and spoke out against racism, extremism and extremist violence”. The report added: “There was a period of national reflection about our shared values, our collective lives and what it means to live in New Zealand.”

New security and intelligence agency, as well as a new counter-terrorism minister, strategy and funding for research into NZ-specific extremism.

New anti-terror and hate-speech laws, as well as social cohesion measures and workplace diversity for the public sector.

Andrew Little has been appointed the minister to implement the inquiry’s recommendations. Revealing the role on Monday, Ardern said: “The [Muslim] community will want to see accountability in terms of the implementation. They will want to know who is responsible for coordinating some of those efforts and we will be providing that.”

Ardern announced the establishment of a ministry of ethnic communities; improvements to the police’s ability to identify and manage hate crime and deliver a service that is more responsive to victims; improved research into extremism; and creating an early intervention programme to support people showing early signs of radicalisation.

## 52, New Zealand election will show how much we have learned from Christchurch

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/24/new-zealand-election-will-show-how-much-we-have-learned-from-christchurch

> Some fringe parties have tried to politicise the broad consensual response to the March 2019 mosque shootings

On 15 March 2019, beginning at 1.40pm, New Zealand experienced a large-scale domestic terrorism attack. A far-right activist shot 42 worshippers dead at the Masjid Al Noor mosque in Christchurch before driving to the Linwood Islamic Centre and killing another nine people.

The overwhelming reaction, from the prime minister down, was one of shock that mass murder of this sort had occurred. New Zealand is not without its own expressions and acts of racism but this was of a magnitude that was unheralded in modern New Zealand.

The attack was completely unanticipated, from the authorities as much as the general public. While there has long been an extreme right which has sought to convince others of the need to oppose diversity recognition – and to act in the interests of white (Pākehā) New Zealanders – their membership is small and their influence minor.

The Christchurch mosque attack unsettled New Zealanders. How could someone hate to such a degree that they would kill? Why didn’t the authorities monitor these sorts of politics more closely? Could we have done anything to stop this attack?

The shooter, a 29-year-old Australian, was arrested and charged. He first appeared before a judge in March 2019, and promptly confirmed his white power beliefs with a hand signal as he entered the dock. In June 2019, he denied the 51 accounts of murder, 40 of attempted murder and one charge under the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, but changed this plea to guilty in March 2020.

The last stage of the judicial process began on Monday. The court hearing is set down for four days, with a summary of the facts, 66 victim impact statements and sentencing.

New Zealand has avoided a long, drawn-out hearing of the sort that occurred in Norway when the Christchurch shooter’s inspiration, Anders Breivik, was charged. But there is still some nervousness concerning the trial.

Will the accused use the courtroom to voice his white supremacist views – and what will the judge do if he tries? Will the process of allowing the Muslim community voice in the court re-traumatise or heal? Will the local and international media who have been accredited to the trial abide by the protocols that have been agreed to?

One particular challenge is that we still know very little about what motivated the shooter to act in the way that he did and why he chose Christchurch to carry out the killings. With the guilty pleas, the very strong security surrounding the killer and the possibility that the court might not allow him to speak, we might never know.

There has been a significant investment, both immediately after the event and over the longer term to try and rebuild public trust and goodwill. The Muslim leadership in New Zealand has played a very impressive role in this. Farid Ahmed lost his wife in the shooting but has been the voice of forgiveness towards the shooter.

New Zealand’s far right has been subdued since the shooting, in part because they have come under much greater scrutiny from the police, and partly because they have realised that there is considerable public antagonism towards the shooter.

That has not stopped the shooter being venerated globally in the dark corners of the web. He influenced others such as the Walmart shooter in El Paso in August 2019.

The Labour-led government moved quickly to pass legislation supporting a ban on automatic guns, with the support of 119 members of parliament (out of 120), and to resource agencies in monitoring the extreme right. But legislation concerning hate speech has been delayed to the frustration of those targeted.

More broadly, there is now a much greater awareness – and sadness – that New Zealand is not exempt from such extreme politics and terrorism. Unfortunately, this awareness and concern is compromised by developments of the last few months.

It is election year in New Zealand and some of the responses prompted by the Christchurch shootings have become politicised, especially by fringe conservative political parties. The New Conservatives, the New Zealand Public party, Vision New Zealand party and the New Zealand Outdoors party variously oppose gun control, see evidence of the deep state in the current government (conspiratorial views of Chinese communist influence), are free speech fundamentalists and express concern about Muslims and Islam. QAnon beliefs about conspiracies buoyed by the anxieties prompted by a pandemic have taken root.

New Zealanders are still trying to come to terms with this country as an unwilling participant in the politics of a contemporary far-right terrorism. There remains sympathy for the Muslim community (“you are one of us” as Jacinda Ardern said soon after the shooting) but time and a political election have frayed the edges of this sympathy.

The question now is whether the sentencing trial reminds New Zealanders of the need to confront racism and extremism – or whether the QAnon conspiracy theorists will see a very different agenda in play and convince other New Zealanders. The results of the election will help answer this question.

Professor Paul Spoonley, Massey University, has been researching the far right in New Zealand since the 1980s. He is currently updating an earlier book on these politics.

## 53, 'Real leaders do exist': Jacinda Ardern uses solace and steel to guide a broken nation

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/19/real-leaders-do-exist-jacinda-ardern-uses-solace-and-steel-to-guide-a-broken-nation

> The 38-year-old prime minister has been tested like no other New Zealand leader before by the worst terrorism attack in the nation’s modern history

In the hours after a gunman killed 50 people at two mosques in central Christchurch, prime minister Jacinda Ardern called a press conference that set the tone for a grief-stricken country. It has become a seminal moment of her leadership story.

The 38-year-old prime minister has been tested like few New Zealand leaders before, leading the country as it deals with the worst terrorism attack in the nation’s modern history.

Fifty people killed while at Friday prayers. Dozens injured. A once peaceful nation in profound shock. Ardern’s voice wavered slightly as she spoke, but her message of unity and compassion was unflinching.

“You may have chosen us,” said Ardern, referring to the killer, anger in her voice. “But we utterly reject and condemn you.”

By Saturday morning she was on the ground in Christchurch with the majority of her cabinet ministers and opposition leaders. Dressed in a black headscarf trimmed with gold, the prime minister met with members of the Muslim community affected by the tragedy. She held them in her arms as they sobbed, whispering words of condolence, and pressing her cheek against theirs. Video footage of those embraces travelled around the world.

Walking hand in hand with those affected, Ardern’s focus was on grieving and commiserating with the affected community. The alleged killer Brenton Tarrant was not representative of New Zealanders’ values and beliefs, she said. Quite simply he was: “Not us”.

“The everyday discourse in New Zealand since the attacks hasn’t been one of hate and anger, it’s been we can do this, we can heal, we can come through this,” says Professor Jennifer Curtin, director of the Public Policy Institute at Auckland University.

“She has shown a quiet, strong leadership, and been very focused on looking after the people who are most affected straight away. The killer has barely been mentioned.”

Paul Buchanan, a security expert for 36th Parallel, says Ardern’s strength was her empathy, and she has “excelled” in this arena during a time of crisis. She is also an expert delegator, Buchanan says, and has delegated security reviews and inquiries about how the killer was missed to senior, trusted colleagues, allowing her to focus on healing a traumatised country.

“She is like the mother of the nation. When it comes to events like this I think her touch is near perfect,” says Buchanan.

“The way Trump and others talk, tough talk, after terror attacks, all that is posturing. And sometimes it is designed to mask weakness, sometimes it is a thirst for revenge. Ardern is doing none of that.”

“It is a leadership style that particularly suits New Zealand. New Zealand does have a serious dark side, it does have racism. But what she is doing is giving us a moment to confront these demons, this darkness and change our ways.”

Her warmth is balanced by a steeliness. When asked about comments by an Australian senator who sought to blame Muslims for the attack, Ardern called him simply “a disgrace”. She has spoken repeatedly about the need to curb the spread of hate speech and violence on social media in the wake of the attacks. Sites that allowed video of the massacre to be shared were “the publisher, not just the postman. There cannot be a case of all profit, no responsibility.”

Speaking in Parliament House on Tuesday, Ardern opened her tribute remarks in Arabic. “As-salaam-alaikum,” she said. “Peace be unto you.”

“One of the roles I never anticipated having and hoped never to have, is to voice the grief of a nation,” she continued.

Refusing to speak the suspect’s name, she moved to strip him of power, instead urging people to speak the names of victims.

“You will never hear me mention his name.”

Domestically, even Ardern’s most strident critics have fallen silent. Sam Sachdeva at Newsroom said the event had allowed the prime minister’s “clarity and decisiveness” to come to the fore, while the New Zealand Herald described her leadership as displaying “solace and steel”.

Those watching around the world, who might previously have only known Ardern as the second female leader to have a baby while in office, have in this last week seen her lead her country with humanity and resolve.

An image of Ardern in a headscarf, framed through a stained-glass window, was immediately picked up internationally and has come to symbolise her leadership in the aftermath.

The Crisis magazine, the publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the US, tweeted of Ardern: “Grace. Dignity. Courage ... Real leaders do exist.”

Australian journalist Peter FitzSimons said Australians wished they could have a leader like Ardern.

“Your prime minister stands out internationally as a leader to inspire people around the world,” Fitzsimons said. “Her poise, her steely resolve and most importantly her language of inclusiveness and diversity was admirable.”

Australian television host Osher Günsberg wrote: “Australia has an election in a few months. Please, please give us someone like Jacinda Ardern to vote for. Please.”

Ardern’s commitment to reform New Zealand’s gun laws in the wake of the shooting also drew praise, with David Hogg, the Parkland school shooting survivor and teenage gun control advocate, sharing a news story about Ardern’s promise to announce gun law changes within 10 days, captioning the tweet: “Imagine.”

The prime minister will again travel to Christchurch on Wednesday to reassure the community that what happened there will never be forgotten. She has already announced that laws to tighten access to semi-automatic weapons are in the works, as well as financial and logistical help with burial costs, and that visas for relatives trying to get to New Zealand for funerals will be fast-tracked.

But largely she will be in Christchurch because her people need her.

At the makeshift memorial at Hagley Park on Tuesday, where paper chains adorn the trees, Christchurch residents unanimously praised Ardern’s “calm, compassionate” response to the massacre. Muslim leaders say her leadership has brought the community together, and made them feel that New Zealand is, and will always be, their home.

“For me, being a Christchurch resident, this is worse than the earthquakes,” one man says. “And I think she feels that, you can tell she feels it deeply.”

> In the wake of New Zealand’s worst terror attack, the prime minister talks frankly about the aftermath, global scrutiny and how a nation heals

“I’ll show you something,” says Jacinda Ardern. We are sitting on sofas in her office on the ninth floor of the Beehive, the circular building that houses the New Zealand government in Wellington. It is just 10 days since a terrorist attack in Christchurch took the lives of 50 people at prayer. Outside, the flags are at half-mast. Two police officers stand by the glass doors, cradling semi-automatic weapons. Up on the ninth floor, the early morning sun scythes in through panoramic windows, the harbour just visible in the distance. In the reception area, a staffer’s preschooler son buzzes back and forth on a bike.

I have been asking Ardern about her immediate response to the attack, which from the outset put a clear emphasis on inclusivity and solidarity. Succinctly, steelily, the prime minister framed what had happened in her own terms. It felt very deliberate: was it?

Not so much, Ardern says. “Very little of what I have done has been deliberate. It’s intuitive. I think it’s just the nature of an event like this. There is very little time to sit and think in those terms. You just do what feels right.”

She crosses the office to her desk and pulls an A4 sheet of paper from a drawer. It’s been folded in half, and in half again, and again. Printed on the back is the running order for an event she hosted in Auckland the night before the attack. On the front are a series of notes, scrawled in Ardern’s rounded handwriting, growing more hurried and less legible as they cross the page. A handful of words have been highlighted in bright orange.

One person custody may be other offndr.

Act of exraordnry violence. It has no place in NZ.

They are us.

“These are my notes for the first press conference,” she explains. “I was in a hotel room. We only had a short amount of time to prepare.”

When the call came, Ardern was travelling in a minivan, sitting alongside the mayor of New Plymouth, a small city on the west coast of the North Island. That morning, Friday 15 March, she had surprised a crowd of local school students who were taking part in the global climate strike. “We hear you. We know we need to act,” she had told them. Later, Ardern was due to officially open a music festival, but at that moment she was on her way to visit the site of a new school.

“The information was patchy and it was very difficult to decipher exactly what had happened,” she recalls. “We didn’t even know a confirmed toll. In an event like this – I can only assume, because I’ve never been through one before – there’s not a lot of time available to think about the language you want to use.

“I absolutely knew what I wanted to say. That, very quickly, was clear to me, when I heard that a mosque had been targeted. I knew what I wanted to say about that straight away. But, no, I didn’t think about particular words. I just thought about sentiments, and what I thought needed to be conveyed.”

Ardern has been at pains to say that what happened on 15 March is not her story, but one that belongs to the victims and their families, to the injured, to Muslim communities, to Christchurch. If there are words that proved defining, they were those spoken by 71-year-old Haji-Daoud Nabi, who moments before being shot dead addressed the gunman from the door of Al Noor mosque, saying: “Hello, brother.”

And yet Ardern’s response, her choice of language, has mattered enormously. In the hours after the attack, in which an Australian-born white-supremacist shot dead 50 unarmed people in two mosques, Ardern said that this was an act of terrorism. She pointedly refused to speak the name of the man who did it. (“He is a criminal. He is an extremist,” she told parliament four days later. “But he will, when I speak, be nameless.”) There was none of the bellicose, war-footing political rhetoric that so often stalks terrorist attacks. Gun law reforms, intended to ban all semi-automatic firearms, were expedited, with cross-party support. An inquiry was commissioned, tasked with asking, among other things, whether an emphasis on jihadi terrorism had meant New Zealand intelligence agencies were looking the wrong way.

The images were just as powerful. On Saturday 16 March, after another press conference in Wellington, Ardern flew south to Christchurch, where she met members of the Muslim community. “I am here today to bring with me the grief of all New Zealand,” she said. “I am here to stand alongside you... We feel grief, we feel injustice, and we feel anger.” She said it wearing a headscarf, an expression of solidarity that sprinted around the world.

“The elements of that surprised me,” says Ardern today. “When I had the all-clear to go down on Saturday, I asked a friend if they had something for me to borrow. If I’d been [at home] in Auckland it would have been different, but I didn’t have scarves with me. So I asked if she had something I could borrow, because for me it was just a mark of respect. It was naturally what you would do. So, no, I didn’t really think about that, either.”

Later, it was suggested to her that it was an important symbol of solidarity with Muslim women in New Zealand, who felt unsafe. “I hadn’t thought about it in those terms. It felt incredibly sad but completely obvious as well, that there would be those who would be worried. You know, the Muslim community was so obviously targeted, and they wear their faith so openly.”

There was no need to deliberate on her decision not to use the name of the terrorist, either: “It just seemed obvious to me.” She had received no report, no advice reflecting the wealth of research that urges political leaders and the media to deny terrorists the notoriety they crave. She had, though, seen the shooter’s manifesto, the 74-page screed he posted online. “I haven’t read it in full, but I saw enough of it to know part of what his aspirations were.”

Among the hideous novelties of the Christchurch attack is the fact that it was livestreamed, in bloody, dystopian detail, on Facebook, before metastasising across the internet, on sites where white supremacy festers, as well as on giant online platforms. Ardern took that on, too, in her parliamentary speech on 19 March, four days after the attack. “There is no question that [the] ideas and language of division and hate have existed for decades, but their form of distribution, the tools of organisation, they are new,” she said. “We cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published. They are the publisher. Not just the postman. There cannot be a case of all profit, no responsibility.”

What, then, does Facebook need to do?

“This isn’t a New Zealand issue, this is a global one,” says Ardern today, carefully choosing her words. “Really, upholding the community standards that they’ve set themselves, I think, is what people are asking for… We’re asking for them to invest in ways to prevent the kind of harm we saw in the aftermath. And, let’s be honest, in the lead up, too.”

Ardern sips from a mug of tea – though she confesses that, years after quitting, she’s also drinking coffee again. Her partner, Clarke Gayford, she smiles, is not impressed. (Later in the day I contact Gayford, host of a television fishing show and father of the couple’s nine-month-old daughter, Neve, asking for his official position on the prime minister having returned to coffee. “Well, considering no night last week finished before midnight and some mornings started before five for her, I can understand,” he replies. A staffer also tells me that Neve has been teething.)

Ardern says she has been taken aback by the volume of press coverage over the past weeks, the scrutiny of her every word. “The conversations about it afterwards – I’ve read these pieces where people have analysed the likes of this [speech],” she says, waving the A4 sheet of notes in her hand, grimly laughing. “This was my first press conference. The second press conference I wrote on my phone on the way to Wellington.”

This interview was due to go to press the day the news of the Christchurch attacks emerged. By then, I had interviewed Ardern twice already: after a breakfast meeting at an Auckland hotel, and a few days earlier at Waitangi, on the northern tip of the North Island. Those interviews took place in early February, and I followed the prime minister as she commemorated the 1840 signing of New Zealand’s founding treaty, between the British Crown and the Māori chiefs.

That article told the story of a leader who was pledging to work harder to address the inequities still faced by New Zealand’s indigenous people. It focused on her pledge to make 2019 a “year of delivery”, and some signs that the halo of the Jacindamania that brought her to office had begun to dim. Pressure was mounting over a failure to meet targets on a flagship house-building scheme. A fight was brewing over the possible introduction of a capital gains tax. Ardern’s Labour-led coalition government was under constant scrutiny: could she achieve the “transformational” reform she’d promised, when every change in the law meant scratching the backs of her coalition partners?

These prosaic-seeming challenges will resurface. But for the time being they feel like the concerns of another time, another galaxy. Ardern agrees. “I was saying to someone the other day how long ago it feels since I was up north [at home]. It does feel as if the passage of time has extended.” When I ask her which day last week a particular foreign dignitary spoke to her, she says, “Time’s a bit of a blur for me,” with a sardonic laugh. It was “half a lifetime ago,” she guesses. “Approximately.”

Half a lifetime and seven weeks ago, I watched Ardern as she sat on the porch of Te Whare Rūnanga, the Maori meeting house at Waitangi. It was shortly after 11am and the speeches, from local elders, from politicians, echoed back and forth across the lawn.

Ardern was grinning. She had just seen her partner return to his spot in the third row of plastic seating with Neve propped up on his knee, having just had a nappy change in the back seat of a car around the corner. The sun was beating down and Neve, in a blue bonnet and spotted dress, clucked away happily.

“I could hear her off to the side. She was being a little bit vocal,” Ardern said when we met later that day, at the hotel down the road. A year earlier, she had become the first female prime minister to speak at the Waitangi pōwhiri, a significant moment in the New Zealand calendar, and the youngest, at 37. Even in utero, Neve had made her presence known. “She used to kick me a lot, but I would especially notice when I came on to marae [a Māori meeting place], probably because of all the noise, the haka and performances. She would boot me a lot.”

Ardern began her speech that day by casting back a year, when she had “asked all of you to hold all of us, and myself, to account”. She highlighted recent reforms to help disadvantaged Māori, to lift children out of poverty, most notably in the form of a “families package” that boosted assistance to low- and middle-income families. “We have more to do,” she said, words she would repeat throughout the day, “but I am an optimist. I was born one and politics has not beaten it out of me yet.” A week ago, I asked her if the Christchurch attack had affected this optimism. “No,” she said. “My belief in the humanity of New Zealanders has strengthened. I just know we have a lot of work to do to make that universal.”

Optimism is baked into Ardern’s character. At school, her mother once revealed, she convened a “happy club”. When she was made leader of the Labour party, with weeks to go before the 2017 election, the campaign was built around a self-described “relentlessly positive” outlook. And while Labour’s manifesto remained essentially unchanged, people suddenly started to listen. “Let’s do this,” went the slogan. Her opponents sneered that it was all just “stardust”, but the party surged on a wave of Jacindamania.

Many predicted that wave would crash on a grumpy rock in the shape of Winston Peters, whose nationalist NZ First (think a hosed-down version of Ukip) held the balance of power after the election. But Peters decided against backing the three-term incumbent National party. It was time to torpedo the status quo, he said, and at 72, he opted to become deputy to a thirtysomething prime minister.

Just a few months later it was revealed that the prime minister was pregnant. The news was announced via Instagram: Ardern, who still runs her own social media accounts, posted a photograph of fish hooks – two regular sized, one tiny – prompting copious media analysis. What did it mean? “The reality was that I went down into the shed, pulled out my fishing box and took out some hooks,” Gayford told me earlier this year. “I thought, yeah, that looks all right, that’ll do.”

Ardern was already famous for her youth; the news that she was to become only the second world leader to give birth in office (after Benazir Bhutto 28 years earlier) went round the world. Here was a progressive upgrade on Canada’s Justin Trudeau: an outward-looking young woman in a global lineup still dominated by greying men. At the UN in New York last September, Ardern made the case for action on climate change, and for “kindness and empathy” in politics – a message amplified by the fact her partner and baby daughter were sitting next to her. US Vogue dubbed her “the anti-Trump”.

As if becoming a mother and prime minister were not challenging enough, Ardern found herself hailed as a standard bearer for women everywhere. “She’s not just leading a country,” gushed Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg last year. “She’s changing the game. And women and girls around the world will be the better for it.”

From a closer proximity, and speaking before the Christchurch attacks, Gayford told me that what he found most impressive was his partner’s grip on the minutiae. “If you could see the amount of reading that is required in that role. It’s 10, 11 o’clock each night, going through cabinet papers. The level of detail that she has to absorb, and is able to retain, blows my mind. Last week I went half a day with my shirt inside out.”

For Ardern, Neve helps keep things in perspective. “I occasionally go to events which may have quite a bit of profile and pressure around them. And then, within 15 minutes, I can be back in the hotel room having Neve spit pumpkin on my shoe. The worlds are in very close proximity. There’s something very grounding about that. A lot of pumpkin. In the shoe.”

The prime minister was deep in conversation with her press secretary when she arrived for the formal part of our interview at Waitangi in February. “We’re deciding whether I can get away with jandal-wear for the latter part of the afternoon,” she confided. They resolved against the flip-flops, and settled on flats. It had just gone 2pm, and a wall of the meeting room was lit in horizontal lines, stencilled through Venetian blinds. The Guardian’s photographer asked Ardern to stand in the stripes, a film-noirish sort of pose. “Maybe with your sincerity, not your smile,” suggested the photographer.

“I struggle not to smile,” Ardern said through clenched teeth. “I look like I’m pouting. Terrible bone structure. It looks like a pout every time.”

Towards the end of her Waitangi speech, she had quoted Michael Savage, the venerated Labour statesman who led the party to government for the first time in 1935: “We don’t claim perfection, but what we do claim is a considerable advance on the past.” It’s a line that Ardern had rolled out in at least three big recent speeches, and felt, in part, like a plea to dial down the Jacindamania – a call to pragmatism.

“I am a pragmatic idealist,” she told me. “I will always strive for better. But I am pragmatic about how much time that sometimes takes.” The optimism tends to win out. “The alternative option is that we come out and say, for instance, on child poverty, that we’ve got these really minimalist targets. And have people say, ‘Where’s your ambition?’”

Under New Zealand’s proportional system – in which people get two votes, one for their local politician and one for a party, as in Germany – a single-party majority is near impossible. This means Ardern must negotiate with both NZ First and the Green party to advance any legislation. But she says she enjoys this part of the job: “I don’t get exasperated or frustrated by it.” Really? I found this hard to believe. “Oh, you know, sometimes you want things to be resolved a bit quicker, but I go in knowing I have to have those conversations. I’m only in government because two parties decided to work with us.”

Ardern alighted on the benefits of New Zealand’s system when I asked for her take on Brexit. The very mention prompted a grimace: “There are very few international political experiences quite like Brexit.” But she wouldn’t volunteer any advice for Theresa May, who at the time had narrowly survived a no-confidence motion. “The only thing I’d say is that, as much as we inherited the Westminster system, we thankfully also have moved to an MMP [mixed-member proportional] system,” she said. The system makes the sort of deadlocks witnessed in the Commons this year much less likely. “We have consensus really built into our system. It changes, probably more than we know, the way we work… By our very nature, I think we probably do things a bit differently.”

Jacinda Ardern grew up in the conservative, rural North Island town of Morrinsville. She was raised a Mormon, but quit the church in her early 20s, principally because of its stance on homosexuality. After completing a communications degree, she worked for a short stint in the Beehive of the last Labour prime minister, Helen Clark, who recalls noticing Ardern’s promise when she was on a team drafting answers for parliamentary questions. (I spoke to Clark a few days after the Christchurch attack, and she told me Ardern’s response had resonated because it was authentic. “She’s not putting on an act. It’s very genuine, and people warm to that. The critical thing has been the inclusive approach. To see people from across society, people who maybe have never even known anyone who goes to a mosque, come out with the flowers and the donations and say: this is not the New Zealand we know and love.”)

In 2008, Ardern was elected president of the International Union of Socialist Youth, a role that took her around the world. Earlier that decade, she lived for two and a half years in London, where she worked in Tony Blair’s Cabinet Office. Blair was another Labour leader who came to office on a wave of progressive euphoria. I pointed this out when we met again in Auckland, and Ardern leaned back with a sigh, knowing where this was going. She worked only “very indirectly” for Blair, she said. “I never met him while I worked for him. Cabinet is a massive beast.” Of the Blair years more broadly, she said: “What you do with policy, it demonstrated to me, can be completely overshadowed by decisions in principle. You think of Tony Blair’s period, now, and what do people talk about? The Iraq war. So for me, that means always having a mind on, yes, the policy work, yes, the domestic work – but actually what legacy do you leave through some of those bigger, overarching decisions as well?

“There was a real sense of hope at the time Blair was elected,” she continued, “because people were ready for things to be done differently. And so I see that there was a weight of expectation there. But, otherwise, I don’t tend to draw parallels.” She paused. “I’ll just leave it there.”

But she didn’t leave it there, picking up on a thread from our conversation in Waitangi earlier in the week. “I think we were musing about this – the risk of ambition. Sometimes, what you’re promoting isn’t tangible. Sometimes, what you’re promoting are things like wellbeing, these ambitious but intangible things.” She doesn’t want to lower the bar, to be someone who “only has regard to political measures of success and says, ‘Well, I’m only going to set these ambitions, and talk in this way, because I don’t want to be judged harshly for not having achieved them.’”

When Ardern was made leader of the Labour party in 2017, she and Gayford were struggling to start a family. She put it frankly to me: “I didn’t know if I was going to be able to have kids.”

Then it all happened at once. “Now I’m finding out what every parent finds out: it’s not about what’s possible or what’s not, it’s about making it work. You just have to. There’s no point at which you can say: ‘I give up on being a parent’ or ‘I give up on doing this job.’”

There is no nanny. Gayford is the primary caregiver and shuttles back and forth with Neve between their home in Auckland and Wellington. The couple’s mothers are the main backup unit, especially when Gayford is away shooting Fish Of The Day, his fishing-travel-cooking hybrid show for the National Geographic channel. “We’re trying to do it ourselves and with our family,” said Ardern. “That may not always be the case, but for now we’re making it work.”

As for being pronounced a “game changer” for women, Ardern welcomed the idea she might inspire others, but was eager to present a truthful picture. “I think people don’t want us to be perfect,” she said. “I’m making an assumption here, but everyone knows that raising kids is hard work and I don’t expect they’d want someone to gloss over that or pretend it’s easy. I can do what I do because I have help and I try to talk about that a lot.”

What about the “anti-Trump” label, I asked her. “It still makes me laugh that Vogue came up with that,” she said. But she is done with that kind of question. “I would like to just do my job and be judged on being the prime minister of New Zealand,” said Ardern. “I get asked: ‘Do you compare yourself to X or Y politician?’ and I’ll then get a string of male politicians from around the world – mostly, to be fair, because there aren’t too many females. And my response to that? I wonder if they get asked the same question. ‘Do you liken yourself to Jacinda Ardern?’ And my bet is that no one would. So I actually think that, in New Zealand, we do things our own way.”

Following the Christchurch attacks, Ardern was asked at a press conference if she agreed with Trump’s downplaying of the rise of white supremacy. “No,” she said, bluntly. Trump had by then called to offer his condolences, and asked what he could do to help. Ardern’s suggestion was that he could provide “sympathy and love for all Muslim communities”. Within hours, Trump was doing the opposite, throwing his weight behind a Fox News broadcaster who had questioned the patriotism of a Muslim congresswoman, Ilhan Omar, because she wore a hijab.

Didn’t that make her angry, I ask Ardern when we meet in Wellington. “I said what I needed to say,” she says, pausing and taking a slow, diplomatic breath of air, her hands clasped around her knees. “Whether or not I thought he would necessarily take on board what I said, is another question. But I said what I needed to say.”

I try again. Wouldn’t it be good if the president of the United States showed greater moral leadership? Ardern stares out the question for several seconds, grimacing. “I think, as leaders, sometimes we’re unaware of our reach and power,” she says. “Sometimes I think we tend to think about our own actions in confined ways, and we underestimate the impact that we have. Yes.”

In the past weeks, New Zealand has reckoned with its own history. One Christchurch-based broadcaster issued an apology for an earlier column about Islam, saying, “I look back at my comments ashamed.” And in a powerful speech a week after the attack, Gamal Fouda, the imam of Al Noor mosque, where 42 worshippers were killed, said the murders “did not come overnight”, but were “the result of the anti-Muslim rhetoric of some political leaders, media agencies and others”.

He may have had in mind Ardern’s deputy Peters, whose NZ First has delivered dog whistles about immigrants and “New Zealand values” for decades. Will she be speaking to him about his xenophobic rhetoric? She doesn’t need to, she suggests. “For me, it’s implicit now,” she says. Following the attacks, she points out, it was Peters who decided to travel to Turkey for a meeting of the international Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, where he met Recep Tayyip Erdoğan; the Turkish president had been screening images from the terrorist’s video at rallies, and declaring that visitors from Australia and New Zealand who expressed anti-Islamic sentiments would be “returned in coffins”. “[Peters] said ‘I think we need to be there,’” says Ardern. “That was his instinct and it was the right one. He took our minister for ethnic communities with him, and made a powerful statement. So I think it’s implicit for him now, too.”

A fortnight after the attack, a national remembrance service is held at Hagley Park in Christchurch, not far from Al Noor Mosque. Armed police are everywhere. Dozens of buses are parked sideways around the perimeter, forming makeshift ramparts. Bunches of flowers, handmade cards and soft toys line the footpath. Locals started leaving tributes here on 15 March; today they form a river, filling the pavement for 250 metres.

Among the speakers this morning is 13-year-old Salma, who stands at the microphone and says, simply, of her father, Ashraf, who was killed: “He was a really nice man.” Farid Ahmed’s wife, Husna, was killed at Al Noor Mosque, too. He has forgiven the man who did it. “I will forgive lavishly, because this heart doesn’t want any more life to be lost,” he tells the crowd.

The 50 names of the dead are read aloud, the only other sound the whirring of a police helicopter in the distance. A crescent moon hangs in the blue sky above.

Ardern is wearing a traditional Māori cloak and, even before she begins speaking, is given a standing ovation. In the past her invocations of kindness might have been dismissed as slogans. Not today. “We each hold the power, in our words and in our actions, in our daily acts of kindness,” she says. “We are not immune to the viruses of hate, of fear, of other. We never have been. But we can be the nation that discovers the cure.”

After the service I meet Tofazzal Alam, a Bangladesh-born New Zealander who was in the Linwood mosque when it was attacked. When the shooting began, he threw himself to the ground. He called his wife. “I said, ‘Can you please call 111. Someone is killing us.’” Ardern’s words and actions have been “really important for our community, and for people who have lost loved ones,” he says. “It’s made a huge difference.”

At Waitangi in early February, I had asked Ardern about the international attention she had attracted – for being young, for being a new mother. It just wasn’t something she thought about, she said, hardly at all. Of course she needed to project New Zealand’s voice, but her focus was on domestic priorities. Today, in the most appalling circumstances imaginable, she has the world’s ear. What would she like to see other nations, other leaders, draw from New Zealand’s experiences?

“Humanity. That’s it. Simple,” she says, nodding her head. “People have remarked upon the way we’ve responded, but to me there was no question. You need to remove some of the politics sometimes and just think about humanity. That’s all.”

## 56, 'A new kind of soft power': Jacinda Ardern appears on cover of Time magazine

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/a-new-kind-of-soft-power-jacinda-ardern-appears-on-cover-of-time-magazine

> PM’s ‘strength and sanity’ praised in profile ahead of anniversary of Christchurch massacre

Jacinda Ardern has appeared on the cover of Time magazine ahead of the anniversary of the Christchurch mosque shootings, in which 51 people were killed by a gunman.

New Zealand’s prime minister was praised for her empathetic leadership following the mass shooting, which occurred on 15 March. The trial of the accused is set for June.

Following the country’s largest terror event in modern history, Ardern donned a hijab and spoke out forcefully against racism and division, repeating the phrase: “they are us”, which began a catch cry of solidarity with the country’s Muslim community. Ardern has also refused to speak the accused’s name – a gesture many have adopted in New Zealand.

The cover of the international edition of Time features the quote “Know us by our deeds”, taken from the prime minister’s recent address at the Big Gay Out, an LGBT festival she has attended for more than a decade, while the headline pointedly asks: “Jacinda Ardern Has the World’s Attention. How Will She Use It?”

In the profile, author Belinda Luscombe describes Ardern as a “millennial woman” and writes of the prime minister: “Ardern’s real gift is her ability to articulate a form of leadership that embodies strength and sanity, while also pushing an agenda of compassion and community”, adding that Ardern has “infused New Zealand with a new kind of soft power” and doesn’t have to request meetings with world leaders anymore, they are now lining up to be associated with her.

“Now her challenge is to prove this new style of leadership can get meaningful results,” Luscombe writes, touching on some of the Labour Coalition’s challenges, such as the housing crisis and child poverty.

With the general election just seven months away, Luscombe asks Ardern what her plans are if she doesn’t win.

“Absolutely zero plan B.” Ardern said. “But actually that’s not new … that’s always been my way of being. It’s probably how I’ve ended up in politics.”

Ardern has also graced the cover of Vogue, among others, and been the subject of numerous glossy profiles. She has also twice been named on Time’s annual list of the world’s most influential people.

Her international popularity has sparked a small-scale backlash back home, with some people turning over covers of magazines featuring Ardern as a form of protest, saying they want their leader to put more of her focus on domestic problems, rather than international publicity.

Ardern has not commented on the protest.

## 57, Jacinda Ardern is showing the world what real leadership is: sympathy, love and integrity

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/18/jacinda-ardern-is-showing-the-world-what-real-leadership-is-sympathy-love-and-integrity

> The New Zealand prime minister has reacted to the Christchurch shootings with steel, compassion and absolute clarity. And she has given us a vision of a better world

Out of the horror inflicted by those who cannot accept the world as it is, comes a vision of a better world. It comes from above and it comes from below. It comes from ordinary people. Supermarkets in Wellington suburbs have sold out of flowers, tough old football coaches are talking about love and, most powerful of all, there are the stories of the Christchurch shooting survivors themselves. Those who risked – and lost – their lives to save their fellow worshippers or – astonishingly – found it in their hearts to forgive the gunman.

Then there is this 38-year-old woman: the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern. We have watched as she shows the world what real leadership is. Jacinda–mania had died down since 2017, when she became the country’s youngest prime minister. She gave birth in office, taking her baby to the United Nations general assembly meeting. She became something of a celebrity, appearing on US chatshows. But was there any substance to her? That question is asked of all women leaders. What is underneath? Where is the steel?

Now, in the most horrific of circumstances, we have seen the steel. We have seen the qualities that define leadership in such a way that it is clear she is a lioness and that to call so many of our current leaders donkeys is a disservice to hardworking donkeys the world over.

She has communicated quickly and immediately, giving New Zealanders as much information as she could. She has given them a language in which to talk about the unspeakable, to vocalise the shock and sadness. “They are us,” she said simply of the dead and wounded. The “othering” of Muslims as separate, as somehow different, as not quite belonging, was felled in one swoop. “They are us.” New Zealand had been chosen because it was safe, because it was no place for hatred or racism. “Because we represent diversity, kindness, compassion, home for those who share our values. Refuge for those who need it.”

These values would not be shaken by the murders. To the killer, she said with absolute clarity: “You may have chosen us – we utterly reject and condemn you.”

This was swiftly followed by a promise to tighten gun laws, making sure that costs of the funerals were paid and that there was financial assistance for those affected. The next day, she went to Christchurch, taking leaders of all political parties, not just her own. She stood with Islamic leaders and hugged the grieving. This showed respect and real compassion, and those striking images flew around the world. A counter to the picture of the stubby bullish killer who was still flashing signs apparently to white supremacists.

Asked directly whether she agreed with Donald Trump that rightwing terrorism was not growing, she answered clearly: “No.” How could the US help? “Sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.”

Sympathy and love, what kind of leader talks like that in a world where to be tough is to build walls and imprison children or, on our own shores, elevate intransigence and prevarication to new heights?

Trump threatens all with the military in his quasi–Mussolini style. While Theresa May could not communicate any of this warmth or leadership in the aftermath of Grenfell.

That leadership could be about compassion and that overused word “empathy” feels freeing to us now. It wasn’t always this way. Dwight Eisenhower once said: “The supreme quality of leadership is unquestionably integrity.” Ardern embodies this; meaning what she says, saying what she means, unafraid and unbowed.

Māori doing their immensely powerful haka, Ardern’s face full of sorrow but also fearlessness, ordinary citizens with aftershocks of expression of love and bravery – this will stay with me. Martin Luther King said genuine leaders did not search for consensus but moulded it.

Ardern has moulded a different consensus, demonstrating action, care, unity. Terrorism sees difference and wants to annihilate it. Ardern sees difference and wants to respect it, embrace it and connect with it. Here is an agnostic showing that love will dismantle hate. This is leadership, this light she shines, guiding us though to a world where we see the best of us as well as the worst.

 This article was amended on 19 March 2019 to state that Ardern is an agnostic not an atheist.

## 58, ‘I don’t understand’: Jacinda Ardern mystified by lack of US gun control

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/15/i-dont-understand-jacinda-ardern-mystified-by-lack-of-us-gun-control

> New Zealand prime minister says laws changed after massacres in her country and in Australia 

New Zealand’s prime minister has said she cannot understand America’s failure to ban automatic and semi-automatic guns, despite dozens of mass shootings.

Jacinda Ardern told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in unusually blunt language: “Australia experienced a massacre and changed its laws. New Zealand has had its experience and changed its laws. To be honest with you, I don’t understand the United States.”

Ardern is in Paris where she is lobbying countries and global tech companies to sign the “Christchurch Call”, a voluntary pledge that aims to eradicate terrorist and violent content online in the wake of the worst mass shooting in New Zealand’s modern history.

The US is not sending anyone to the meeting of digital ministers from the Group of 7 nations to discuss the plan, and is not intending to sign the pledge.

The day before the summit, Facebook said it was tightening rules on use of its livestreaming feature, which was used to broadcast the Christchurch attack. It said people who have faced disciplinary action for breaking Facebook’s most serious rules would be temporarily suspended from using the Live function.

Facebook did not specify which offences were eligible or how long suspensions would last, but a spokeswoman claimed it would not have been possible for the attack to have been livestreamed.

Talking to Amanpour, Ardern said that before the Christchurch mosque shootings on 15 March, in which 51 people died, New Zealand had “pretty permissive gun legislation”.

But despite New Zealand being a hunting and food-producing nation, that was not justification enough for access to high-powered military-style rifles, Ardern said, and the Labour coalition government passed legislation banning access within weeks of the massacre.

“We will continue to be a food-producing nation that deals with animal welfare issues and so on, and has a practical purpose and use for guns, but you can draw a line and say that that does not mean that you need access to military-style semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles. You do not. And New Zealanders, by and large, absolutely agreed with that position,” Ardern said.

Six days after the Christchurch mosque attacks, the New Zealand the government announced it would ban all military-style semi-automatics (MSSA) and assault rifles in New Zealand. Related parts used to convert these guns into MSSAs were also banned, along with all high-capacity magazines.

In the days and weeks after the Christchurch shootings, hundreds of New Zealanders voluntarily surrendered their weapons to police, before an official government buy-back scheme was launched that is expected to cost NZ$100-200m ($65m-$130m).

## 59, Christchurch massacre survivors call for Australia to pay gunman's prison bill

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/02/christchurch-massacre-survivors-call-for-australia-to-pay-gunmans-prison-bill

> Jacinda Ardern will talk to families of those killed, who say New Zealand should not pay for keeping the Australian terrorist locked up for life

Some survivors of the mosque massacre in Christchurch are calling for Australia to pay for the lifetime prison sentence of the gunman, who killed 51 worshippers last year.

Last week Justice Cameron Mander sentenced Brenton Tarrant, who is an Australian citizen, to life in prison without parole for the murders of 51 people at two inner-city Christchurch mosques in March of 2019.

It is the first time anyone in New Zealand has been sentenced to life without parole. The Australian gunman is expected to be held in solitary confinement in the maximum-security Paremoremo prison at a cost estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars over the course of his lifetime. Tarrant is 29 years old.

Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said she would speak to Christchurch families after a number said Australia should foot the bill for his imprisonment. The cost of Tarrant’s incarceration is around NZ$5,000 (A$4,600) a day, according to the prime minister.

Tarrant grew up in the New South Wales town of Grafton and moved to New Zealand in late 2017, when he began planning his terrorist attack on two mosques, and frequenting local gun clubs.

After he was sentenced, Winston Peters, the deputy prime minister, said he should be sent back to Australia. “Now is the time for Australia’s minister of home affairs, Peter Dutton, to receive and carry out the terrorist’s sentence in Australia,” he said.

“The Islamic community and all of New Zealand has already suffered enough without having to pay astronomical prison costs to keep him safe in our prison system.”

However, John Milne whose 14-year-old son Sayyad Milne was killed in the attack, told RNZ he wanted Tarrant to serve out his sentence in New Zealand. “We can’t let him go [be deported], we’ve lost control of what happens to him,” said Milne.

“I think Australia needs to pay the total cost for what we’ve spent already, they need to pay that plus ongoing. They need to cough up big time. There’s a big bill out there for this now, he’s Australian, not a Kiwi, we shouldn’t have to pay for any of it.”

Survivor Abdul Aziz chased the gunman from Lindwood mosque. He thinks the millions being spent on Tarrant’s incarceration could be redirected if Australia picked up the tab.

“That money you know we can do a lot better things than spending it on that coward,” Aziz said.

Opposition Leader Judith Collins disagrees with the terrorist being deported, because it could result in more New Zealanders being deported from Australian jails, a long-term issue that has placed considerable strain on the Trans-Tasman relationship.

Feroze Ditta, the general secretary of the Muslim Association of Canterbury, said it was important the gunman remained in New Zealand to serve his sentence. “He committed the crime in New Zealand. He got tried by the New Zealand courts, is [serving a] sentence in a New Zealand prison. That’s where he should remain.”

The debate follows a move on Tuesday by the New Zealand government to designate Tarrant “a terrorist entity”. The decision freezes his assets and makes it a criminal offence to support his activities.

“Designating the offender is an important demonstration of New Zealand‘s condemnation of terrorism and violent extremism in all forms,” Ardern said in a statement. “This designation ensures the offender cannot be involved in the financing of terrorism in the future.”

Ardern and the Department of Corrections have been contacted for comment.

## 60, New Zealand's Muslims have put their faith in the Christchurch inquiry to help protect and heal

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/26/new-zealands-muslims-have-put-their-faith-in-the-christchurch-inquiry-to-help-protect-and-heal

> The Islamic Women’s Council of NZ gave more than 1,000 pages of evidence to the royal commission in the hope of a better country

By the time that you read this, New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, will have received a several-tome report from the royal Commission of Inquiry into the Terrorist Attack on Christchurch Mosques, which will provide findings on whether the government authorities could have prevented the horrific event and will offer recommendations to avert any terrorism in the future.

As the person charged with government engagement for the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand (IWCNZ), I have a keen interest in reading the commission’s conclusions given that our organisation had warned government authorities several times that our Muslim community was at risk and needed support. Importantly, the report has the potential to transform how the government interacts with all its communities. Harking back to the wise words of New Zealand’s “mother of the nation” Dame Whina Cooper, I hope that this report becomes the seed that plants in the hearts of Kiwis “a vision of Aotearoa where all our people can live together in harmony … and share the wisdom from each culture”.

At the outset, the royal commission appeared it would be fraught with challenges. Due to the way New Zealand’s Crown law drafted the terms of reference, much of the commission’s process has been shrouded in secrecy. The open and transparent processes on which New Zealand prides itself were omitted. In a first, no public hearings have been held, and the Muslim community has not been permitted to see, vet or challenge any evidence presented outside their own. Still, the two commissioners – a retired supreme court judge and a former ambassador – alongside the commission’s secretariat have slowly, yet surely, been able to gain the trust of many of those affected and those within our battered community.

The commission showed a willingness to listen, to learn, to adapt, and to correct when appropriate. As just one example of this, while the initial list of the ministries and agencies to be looked into was small, after listening to community, the commission expanded it to include more than 200. The commission reached out to the families, calling meetings where those directly affected could be updated and remain informed. Likewise, a Muslim reference group was created. Nine meetings followed over the next 15 months, with consultations on a variety of topics, where ideas and possible solutions were probed.

Simultaneous to this, IWCNZ sought and obtained “core participant” status after its evidence relating to years of government engagement was tested. IWCNZ leadership reviewed their government engagement over a five-year period and presented a submission bolstered by more than 1,000 pages of evidence supporting its position that the attacks were preventable. Members of IWCNZ leadership were interviewed and provided evidence over several days. We offered suggestions and recommendations. All sessions were emotionally challenging, deeply personal and raw. I can attest that we shared our stories and provided our evidence with sincerity, trust and hope for a better New Zealand.

The commission report was first due to be issued a year ago, but due to the depth of the inquiry, that date was extended and then with the pandemic, it was pushed back two more times. Thus, New Zealand as a nation and, within it, the Kiwi Muslim community have waited a long time for the answers we seek – was the Christchurch terrorist attack preventable and what can we as a nation do to stop another such act from occurring? The prime minister and her cabinet now know that answer.

We anticipate the large report will not just provide a statement of facts and identify the causes of what happened on 15 March, but we hope it will also include thorough and substantive recommendations on how to avoid any such devastation again. We hope it will detail the lapses in the civil service in a way that will help those agencies to work with more agility and effectiveness for the public and the nation they are serving, and not just the people who directly appoint them.

We hope it includes recommendations on how the government can best support the wellbeing of those directly impacted by the attacks. We also hope the report includes clear ideas on how the government can address the rising hate and “othering”, and offers suggestions on how to maintain and further promote that togetherness that the nation showed immediately after the attack. Most of all, we hope it inspires this nation as a whole to do more, to do better and to put things right – not just for our Muslim community, but for all communities within this beautiful nation.

Aliya Danzeisen has led the government engagement for the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand for seven years and has played a key advocacy role in getting support for the Kiwi Muslim community.

## 61, Leaders and tech firms pledge to tackle extremist violence online

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/15/jacinda-ardern-emmanuel-macron-christchurch-call-summit-extremist-violence-online

> Jacinda Ardern and Emmanuel Macron host Christchurch Call summit in Paris

World leaders and heads of global technology companies have pledged at a Paris summit to tackle terrorist and extremist violence online in what they described as an “unprecedented agreement”.

Wednesday’s event, two months to the day since the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand, drew up a “plan of action” to be adopted by countries and companies to prevent extreme material from going viral on the internet.

Known as the Christchurch Call, it was organised by New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in response to the attack on the Christchurch mosque on 15 March in which 51 people were killed.

The gunman, a 28-year-old Australian, livestreamed the attack on Facebook from where it was shared online around the world. The footage was picked up by some international media outlets who initially published excerpts of the video and links to the gunman’s extremist “manifesto” before quickly dropping them in the face of political and public outrage.

Macron and Ardern met ministers from G7 nations and leaders of internet companies including Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter. Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, did not attend.

The initiative calls on signatory nations to bring in laws that ban offensive material and to set guidelines on how the traditional media report acts of terrorism. However, as a voluntary initiative it is for individual countries and companies to decide how to honour their pledge.

Britain, Canada, Australia, Jordan, Senegal, Indonesia, Norway and Ireland signed the pledge, along with the European commission, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, YouTube, Daily Motion and Quant.

France’s Elysée Palace said Germany, India, Japan, Holland, Spain and Sweden had expressed support for the Christchurch Call.

The US has reportedly refused to sign up because of concerns about freedom of speech.

At a press conference after the Paris meeting, Macron made reference to recent attacks in Sri Lanka and the killing of two French soldiers by terrorists in Burkina Faso.

He said: “Our aim is simply that what has happened in each of these places never happens again. Christchurch was not just an abject terrorist attack, it was the transformation once again of the internet into a crazy propaganda machine used for the fracture of our society.

“The war of everyone against everyone else [is] an objective of extreme right and Islamist terrorists. The objective of our joint initiative is to enlarge the field of action. We have decided to act.”

Ardern said the Christchurch attack was “truly unprecedented in its use of social media and subsequent spread of the terrorist’s message. Fifty-one men, women and children from the New Zealand Muslim community were killed, and were killed online. Initially the live stream was watched by only a few hundred people but it was then shared and spread online at such a pace that YouTube recorded one upload per second on their platform in the first 24 hours.”

She added: “Never have so many countries and tech companies come together in reaction to such an attack to work together to use new technology and develop new technology so our communities are safer.

“Today must be day one of change. The Christchurch Call is a roadmap for action. It’s a nine-point commitment that I hope will bring lead to further change … to eliminate terrorism from the networks.”

She said she hoped it would lead to a “more human internet that cannot be used by terrorists for their hateful purposes”.

Macron said things were moving in the right direction and the presence of the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and his “personal engagement” was encouraging.

“They said they support the objectives they will do all to cooperation, they haven’t formally signed up to the Christchurch Call but we will do all we can to have a more concrete and formal engagement. The fact the US administration has said it shares our objectives is a positive element,” Macron said.

He said the Christchurch Call differed from previous initiatives to clean up the internet, because of the involvement of tech companies and its worldwide appeal.

Ardern said Facebook had made a changes to its livestreaming, announced at the same time as the summit, under which the Christchurch terrorist “would not have been able to livestream his act of violence”.

She said: “That is just one element of the work of we must do. Ultimately we want to be in a position to prevent harm in the first place, to make sure that lives aren’t lost.”

## 63, 'The nation is behind us': New Zealand shares pain of Christchurch Muslims

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/24/the-nation-is-behind-us-new-zealand-shares-pain-of-christchurch-muslims

> One week after massacre, deputy mayor describes a ‘city in shock’ but feels legacy will be one of greater understanding

It began to drizzle as Hati Mohemmed Daoud Nabi was laid to rest in the freshly dug earth of Memorial park cemetery in Christchurch.

The 71-year-old was the fifth to be buried on Thursday. Six days earlier, he was the first to die when he held open the door of Masjid Al Noor on Deans Avenue in Christchurch and greeted a stranger with: “Hello, brother.”

That stranger is now in custody, pending charges for 50 counts of murder for attacks on Masjid Al Noor and a second mosque on Linwood Avenue. It is the worst terrorist attack in the country’s history. The youngest victim was just three years old. As of Thursday, 28 of the 42 injured remained in hospital.

The attack was motivated by hatred of Muslims, but its result was an outpouring of love and support in a heartbroken country. Thousands of non-Muslims have since attended a mosque for the first time; school students performed a haka for the fallen; non-Muslim women (including prime minister, Jacinda Ardern) donned headscarves; and across the nation, New Zealanders pledged to form a human chain around mosques to protect those who prayed.

It also promoted action. An hour after Daoud was buried, prime minister Jacinda Ardern banned the sale of military-style assault rifles, semi-automatic rifles and shotguns with a detachable magazine, and high-capacity magazines — the primary weapons that police allege were used in the attack.

On Thursday evening more than 18,000 people attended a candlelit vigil for the victims in Dunedin, the second-biggest city on New Zealand’s South Island after Christchurch.

The 28-year-old Australian man suspected of the attacks lived in Dunedin, 360km south. He has been named in court, but Ardern has promised never to speak his name.

On Friday, a week after the massacre, the Muslim call to prayer was broadcast on national TV and radio in New Zealand followed by a two-minute silence. Outside Masjid Al Noor, a large crowd gathered to observe the midday prayers. Later, 26 of the remaining victims were laid to rest in a mass burial.

Luul Ibrahim, whose little brother Mucad, 3, was among those buried, said she lived in Australia and had not had the chance to meet her brother, adding “maybe one day I will meet him in heaven”.

From a podium about 200 metres from the mosque, Imam Gamal Fouda said New Zealand has proved itself “unbreakable” and called for action to stamp out Islamophobia and hate speech.

“Last Friday I stood in this mosque and saw hatred and rage in the eyes of the terrorist,” he said. “Today from the same place I look out and I see the love and compassion in the eyes of thousands of New Zealanders and human beings from around the globe.”

Ardern kept her speech brief, reciting an Islamic proverb then saying: “New Zealand mourns with you, we are one.”

At the end of the service, the crowd were offered a simple message in Te Reo Maori: “Aroha, aroha, aroha.” Love, love, love.

At kitchen tables in Christchurch, quiet conversations are happening between New Zealanders about whether they might have laughed off racism and hate speech when they should have taken the threat of white nationalism seriously. In Australia those same conversations have become mired in partisan political debate.

Everyone in Christchurch lives in readiness for the next big earthquake, but few – including authorities – were prepared for this man-made disaster.

Until 15 March, the idea of a rightwing terror attack in New Zealand was considered so unlikely by everyone except those directly exposed to anti-Muslim sentiment that even security agencies missed the warning signs.

“I would hope to think one nasty bastard is not going to affect our country and how we think about ourselves,” Christchurch woman Rachel McCormick says. She is at the public memorial outside the botanic gardens on Rolleston Avenue with two of her children, delivering flowers and a message written by her five-year-old son.

The message reads: “Why didn’t the angry man just ask why they pray?”

McCormick says the attack sparked “so many conversations about Kiwi racism”, about pride in Ardern’s compassionate performance as leader, and about gun control, although the latter is just an instant declaration of “totally, 100% support”.

Christchurch City Council’s deputy mayor, Andrew Turner, says his home is still “a city in shock” but there are “some questions that needed to be answered” about racism and intolerance in New Zealand.

“I would like to think that any legacy of this as far as possible can be positive,” Turner says. “That it leads to a greater understanding of different religions, different communities, a greater level of cultural awareness, and the absolute need to be embracing the diversity in our wider community and also the need to be a voice and a place of welcome to recent immigrants and refugees.”

According to the Mental Health Foundation’s Ciaran Fox, it also shows the need to ensure that migrant communities and recent refugees are brought into the community networks that sprang up in response to the earthquake. Fox attributes the city’s resilience to those networks, which mean that when disaster strikes Christchurch its 374,000 residents “know how to be a community”.

That shows up in the flowers. The Rolleston Avenue memorial has been steadily growing since the afternoon of the attack to cover more than 100 metres of fenceline. It is filled with messages of hope and condolence including the ubiquitous Te Reo affirmation “Kia kaha”, or stay strong. “Kia kaha” is written on a literal bundle of olive branches; in chalk on the pavement; on paper chains made by primary school students; across replicas of the New Zealand flag.

Every few metres a photo of one of the victims sits between the mounds of floral tributes and teddy bears. At one point there is a collection of futsal balls and footballs, a tribute to Atta Elayyan, 33, who was the goalkeeper of the national men’s futsal team, as well as Tariq Omar, 24, and Sayyad Milne, 14, who played for Maitland football club.

A letter left for Omar reads: “When you coach me I feel welcome on the team. I only talked to you last Tuesday and it turns out that was the last time.”

Mohammad Ishaq and daughter Shaheen, 15, came to Christchurch from Auckland on Saturday after learning a cousin had been killed in the attack. They buried him on Wednesday.

“He was just here for a week and last Saturday he was supposed to come to Auckland for a visit but it didn’t happen,” Ishaq says.

He thanks the broader community for its support, saying: “The whole nation is behind us, the whole country is behind us, that’s the thing about Kiwis.”

Shaheen says the level of community support in the wake of the attack gives her hope.

“People have been seeing Muslims in a different way now and that’s something that we actually appreciate. Now we know that we actually can be a part of this community,” she says.

## 64, Christchurch shooting: thousands to attend prayers as mosque prepares to reopen

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/21/christchurch-shooting-ardern-friday-prayer-mosque-reopen-gun-laws

> Mass gathering expected on Friday in park near Al Noor mosque, where 42 people died

Thousands of people are expected to attend Friday prayers in Christchurch as the mosque that was hit first in horrific attacks that killed 50 people prepared to reopen.

Gamal Fouda, the imam of Al Noor mosque, said he was expecting 3,000 to 4,000, including many coming from abroad, to join the prayer, which is likely to be held in Hagley Park, across the road from the mosque.

Forty-two people were killed at Al Noor mosque, which was the first site targeted by the shooter. Members of Linwood mosque, where the gunman killed seven people, will attend the joint prayer.

Fouda says mosque workers have been working round-the-clock to repair the destruction from the 15 March attack. They plan to bury the blood-soaked carpet.

It came as two petitions with a total of 70,000 signatures calling for a ban on semi-automatic weapons was handed to MPs outside parliament, days after prime minister Jacinda Ardern promised New Zealand’s gun laws would change.

On Thursday, Ardern said a two minute silence would be held across the country and that the call to prayer would be broadcast on TVNZ and Radio New Zealand to commemorate the attack.

Meanwhile, funerals continued to take place on Thursday, after bodies began to be released to families on Tuesday night.

At least six more funerals were due to take place on Thursday, including the funeral of Hati Mohammed Daoud Nabi, the 71-year-old man who opened the door of Al Noor mosque to the gunman.

In her address to parliament on Tuesday, Ardern honoured Nabi, saying that as he opened the door to the gunman he “uttered the words ‘Hello brother, welcome’. His final words.”

“Of course he had no idea of the hate that sat behind the door, but his welcome tells us so much – that he was a member of a faith that welcomed all its members, that showed openness, and care,” she said.

Those listed for burial on Thursday also include 14-year-old Sayyad Ahmad Milne, Tariq Rashid Omar, 24, Linda Susan Armstrong, 64, Hussein Mohamed Khalil Moustafa, 70 and Matiullah Safi, 55.

There has been frustration among the families of the victims at the delays in releasing the bodies for burial. In the Islamic faith, bodies should be buried within 24 hours of death, but the first burials occurred on Wednesday.

At her media conference on Wednesday, Ardern said she “shared the frustration” of those who wanted the bodies released faster and the process would be reviewed in the aftermath of the shooting. Earlier in the day, police commissioner Mike Bush said the reason for the delay was that the bodies needed to be identified to an “evidential” standard that could be presented to a coroner.

The first victims to be buried were a father and son who fled the civil war in Syria for “the safest country in the world”.

Khalid Mustafa, 44, and Hamza Mustafa, 15, were killed in the shooting. Hamza’s brother, 13-year-old Zaed, was also hit in the attack and was wounded in an arm and a leg. The boy tried to stand during the funeral ceremony but had to sit back in his wheelchair, one mourner said.

During the funerals, Hamza’s high school principal described him as compassionate and hardworking, and said he was an excellent horse rider who aspired to be a veterinarian.

The Mustafas had moved to New Zealand last year after spending six years as refugees in Jordan. Mustafa’s wife, Salwa, told Radio New Zealand that when the family asked about New Zealand they were told “it’s the safest country in the world, the most wonderful country you can go ... you will start a very wonderful life there.”She added, “But it wasn’t.”

Ardern said the family should have been safe. “I cannot tell you how gutting it is to know that a family came here for safety and for refuge,” she said.

Four other burials took place on Wednesday evening. Those victims include Junaid Ismail, Ashraf Ali and Lilik Abdul Hamid. The fourth victim’s name was suppressed by court order.

Further arrests have been made of those who shared the footage of the mosque attacks or celebrated it.

A resident of the United Arab Emirates who worked for a security firm was detained and deported after making comments on Facebook celebrating the New Zealand mosque attacks.

Transguard Group said its employee, who was not identified, made the comments on his personal Facebook page under an assumed name. Transguard said the employee was stripped of his security credentials, fired and handed over to authorities.

## 65, Jacinda Ardern says cabinet agrees New Zealand gun reform 'in principle'

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/18/christchurch-attack-jacinda-ardern-says-cabinet-has-agreed-in-principle-gun-reform

> Prime minister says government ‘completely unified’ but delays announcement of ban on semi-automatics

Jacinda Ardern has said her cabinet is “completely unified” in reforming gun legislation in the wake of the Christchurch terror attack but emerged from a meeting with ministers without concrete proposals to change firearms laws.

The New Zealand prime minister had been expected to announce measures such as a ban on semi-automatic rifles, a plan that was flagged by her attorney general, David Parker, one day after the massacre in which 50 people died.

However, after emerging from a long cabinet meeting Ardern said her team would take the rest of the week to work out the details after agreeing to make changes “in principle”. The agreement had been reached just 72 hours after the attack, she said, comparing her response time to that of the Australian government after the Port Arthur massacre.

“Within 10 days of this horrific act of terrorism we will have announced reforms which will, I believe, make our community safer,” Ardern said at news conference.

“These aren’t simple areas of law. So that’s simply what we’ll be taking the time to get right,” she said.

Hours before Ardern’s appearance, the country’s biggest online auction site, TradeMe, banned semi-automatics and “associated” accessories, saying “it is clear public sentiment has changed”.

On Monday, an 18-year-old man was charged with distributing a live stream of the mass shooting and was denied bail. He reportedly posted a photograph of one of the mosques attacked with the message “target acquired” among other chat messages “inciting extreme violence”, the New Zealand Herald reported. His name has been suppressed and he is due back in court next month.

Previous efforts to change gun laws failed in 2005, 2012 and 2017. Deputy prime minister Winston Peters, whose NZ First party has previously not supported recommendations to restrict gun laws, said on Monday that, after Friday’s attacks: “Our world changed forever and so will some of our laws.”

On Monday, Ardern also said an inquiry would be launched into the events leading up to the shootings, including the suspect’s travel and social media use and whether concerns voiced by Muslim citizens had been taken seriously.

She urged gun owners to hand in their weapons, and advised anyone considering buying a gun to wait a few days to get some certainty around the laws before investing.

Earlier, David Tipple, the managing director of retailer Gun City, confirmed his company had sold the suspect four weapons – but the gun he used to carry out the mosque shootings was not one of them. Tipple would not be drawn on his views on gun control, but intimated guns were not the issue.

“I had my grandson say to me: ‘Granddad, why do people think the guns were the problem? The guy was crazy.’ He is six years old,” Tipple told a media conference.

Earlier on Monday, TradeMe banned the sale of all semi-automatic weapons and “associated” accessories. Its CEO, Jon Macdonald, said the ban would be reviewed once there was more clarity on future gun laws.

He said: “We’ve had a lot of contact from Kiwis over the weekend about this issue, and many felt that we should stop the sale of these items in the wake of this attack. We’ve listened to these sentiments and we’ve put this ban in place while we await clear direction from the government.”

The focus fell on semi-automatic military-style rifles with high-capacity magazines at the weekend after Ardern said it was believed the weapons used in the attack had been modified and that loopholes that allow such modifications would be closed.

Gun control experts told the Guardian such weapons can be easily converted into a military-style semi-automatic rifle using a high-capacity magazine, the sale of which is not regulated in New Zealand.

The attorney general said such rifles would be banned after it emerged the suspect in Friday’s attack used five guns, two of which were semi-automatics.

Police commissioner Mike Bush has urged locals to return to their normal lives, to remain “vigilant” but to reject fear and reclaim the streets of their city.

But on Monday it was hard for residents to embrace routine and normality as diggers fanned out around the city to prepare 50 graves. Experts in Islamic burial rights also converged on the city.

Raf Manji, a Christchurch city councillor and a Muslim, told Nine to Noon: “There’s a sense of weariness. It’s been a very long, hard weekend, and I think people will be a little bit washed out and will be pleased to be back in their places of work and study, and congregate with their friends and colleagues.

“People coming together will be a good thing for the city … this is an attack on the whole community, we talk about the Muslim community but they’re just part of us, they’re part of our normal everyday life. The way the public has come out here shows the community is rejecting what has happened to it.”

Reactions differed in the wake of the attack, at Christchurch firearms retailer Gun City panic-buying began. One customer, Rick, said on Sunday afternoon there was no reason for anyone to buy a semi-automatic besides “looking cool”. “They are far too strong for hunters, they will rip any animal to shreds,” said Rick, who hunts deer.

Reports emerged of others choosing to hand in their firearms after Friday’s events.

Since I first heard about the atrocity on Friday afternoon I have reflected and reserved my thoughts. Monday morning - this is one of the easiest decisions I have ever made. Have owned a firearm for 31 years. pic.twitter.com/fBFqfd0gTm

Simon Bridges, the leader of the opposition National party, said he understood gun laws needed to change, and his party would work “constructively” with the government to fast-track tighter controls, with a ban on semi-automatics “probably the right way to go”.

“I am open to any and all changes,” said Bridges to Radio NZ.

The Police Association too said it fully supported such plans. Its president, Chris Cahill, said: “Jacinda Ardern has said emphatically that New Zealand’s gun laws will change … I absolutely agree with her. It is sickening that it has taken this horrific event to wake us up to our vulnerability.”

Civilians in New Zealand own an estimated 1.2m firearms, according to the 2017 small arms survey. That makes New Zealand’s per capita rate of gun ownership higher than Australia’s, but still far below the US, where there is more than one gun per person.

The country’s gun laws are largely unchanged since 1992, when controls were tightened after the 1990 Aramoana massacre, in which a man killed 13 people with a semi-automatic rifle.

## 66, Anxious and in pain, survivors of Christchurch massacre call for new approach

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/27/survivors-of-christchurch-massacre-call-for-greater-support-new-zealand

> The injured and bereaved face financial stress, life-long physical issues and mental trauma and want a more flexible response from government

“What happened is unusual, and for unusual things, there should be unusual rules.”

Hisham al Zarzour survived the Christchurch massacre in March, when 51 people were killed by a gunman who entered two mosques during Friday prayers and opened fire. But his struggle isn’t over.

Nearly nine months on, he is among victims of the attack who are calling for a new approach and more understanding from the government, which has promised long-term support but has not always delivered what survivors say they need.

“They can’t deal with unusual things in normal ways,” he says.

Al Zarzour, 33, sits in bright sunlight outside his Christchurch home, his three children shrieking happily as they play around him. In April, he was too nervous to leave his house for the physiotherapy appointments needed to recover from bullet wounds sustained to his leg when he was shot by the gunman in Al Noor mosque. Sometimes he slept on the floor, afraid he might be shot through the window.

He had lived in New Zealand for seven months before the gunman stormed two mosques in the South Island city. The Syrian man was one of dozens who were injured, and suffered a heart attack in the weeks after the shootings. Since then, things have improved in fits and starts: he now sleeps for brief spells every night, waking up two or three times with nightmares – months earlier, he would sometimes go two days at a time without rest.

“My personality is changed now,” he says. “I get angry quickly, and I’m not social like before.”

According to a Christchurch-based organisation that has conducted about 100 recent meetings with victims of the attacks, the bereaved and survivors still face a litany of problems: financial stress from closed businesses and terminated incomes – many of those killed were the breadwinners in their families – life-long physical injuries and mental trauma. Some are still wrestling with New Zealand’s immigration agency, or confronting a lack of cultural understanding from officials designated to work with them.

Raf Manji is a former Christchurch city councillor who is now advising the Christchurch Foundation, the independent charity that carried out the recent interviews. After more than 160 conversations, Manji said it was clear how much support the community still needed, and how much trust needed to be rebuilt after missteps and misunderstandings following the attacks.

He has recommended New Zealand’s government consider a “flexible, bespoke” system of financial support system that runs for at least two years after the shooting, more information-sharing between government agencies, culturally competent support workers, and a long-term mental health and trauma hub – as was established in response to the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.

“Government agencies were told to be flexible, and they certainly were in the frontline strategy,” he said, of the numerous departments – including health, social welfare, compensation, and immigration – that had to work together to meet survivors’ needs following the attack. But, he added, they had eventually “hit walls” in terms of how much help they could provide.

“One thing I often heard … is that they don’t want to set a precedent.”

“The precedent has been set by the mere fact that we have had a mass casualty terror attack. You will not get a bigger precedent than that,” Manji says.

Megan Woods, the minister responsible for the government’s response to the attacks, said in an emailed statement: “This attack was unlike any other in the history of our country, and providing appropriate support for the victims is a complex task but one that it is vital we get right.”

She cited the “dedicated and personalised case managers” each family had been assigned, and added that it was important to balance information-sharing requests between government agencies with “respecting the privacy of victims and their families”.

The government faced extraordinary challenges in responding to the attacks, partly because not all of the community had integrated into New Zealand life, and many did not understand how systems worked, said Zhiyan Basharati, an advocate for the victims in Christchurch who has worked with dozens of victims’ families to raise their complaints with officials.

Sometimes translators provided at meetings did not understand government systems either.

“If we’re going to bring people into the country, we need to make sure that they are integrating, that they feel safe, that there is no fear,” said Basharati, whose family settled in New Zealand as Kurdish refugees in 2001. “And to achieve that outcome, there has to be integration.”

Woods agreed in her statement that “issues around assimilation and integration have come to the fore for the community in the months after the attacks”.

The Christchurch Foundation’s interviews with members of the community came as the organisation prepared to distribute NZ$9m donated from around the world since March; Manji wanted the community’s advice on what to do with the funds.

Such questions have proved fraught. Many victims said an earlier round of more than NZ$10m raised by New Zealand charity Victim Support was disbursed without consulting them. Basharati, the community advocate, said the agency and other bodies had relied too much on the same handful of local community leaders, and the conversations had not filtered down to those most affected.

“Some individuals who are part of the boards, some of them have never seen the faces of the victims. They’ve never spoken to them,” she said. “You go individually, you speak to them, you go to their house, you give them respect individually.”

Some community members criticised a decision to exclude those present at the mosques – but who were not shot – from most of the earlier funding. Others decried the ruling that those with severe, life-changing injuries – a woman paralysed, a man who might lose his hand – were given the same amounts as those with less serious wounds.

The Christchurch Foundation plans, after the conversations with victims, to make payouts to the bereaved families and those shot in the attacks, and to set aside extra funding for the medical costs of those most seriously injured. Other tranches of money are set aside for children’s education, hardship, and community initiatives.

Some of the most severely injured were still recovering in hospital when the first round of funding was distributed, and their voices were absent from the conversations, said Basharati.

In one case, a 25-year-old woman who was paralysed in the attack had been discharged from the hospital to a property that did not accommodate her needs, and had to be driven across the city every time she needed to shower.

The government’s housing agency had been in the process of making modifications to a home for the woman and her husband to move into, but Basharati said she had visited the property and found it was in “revolting” condition.

Manji said when Basharati told him the situation, he helped arrange for the woman’s compensation to be released to her early, and assembled a team of people – including a lawyer who spoke the woman’s first language, and representatives of a local bank – so the woman and her husband could put down a deposit on their own home.

Talking to survivors from month to month reveals the volatile nature of their situations, and the starkly different challenges each family faces. Al Zarzour’s parents and brother have arrived in New Zealand to help him and his wife and children, and are likely to be able to stay long term, providing the government approves visas for them.

The presence of his relatives had been comforting and helpful, he said, but “more responsibility” too; once their visas are processed, he must help them find jobs and a place to live.

“They are my family, and it is my responsibility to find for them a house to rent and buy a car and then to buy the things in the house,” says al Zarzour, who survived after the shootings on donated grocery vouchers. “This will cost a lot of money.”

His landlord has told him he must vacate his rental home by April, so he must also find a new house for his family of five. He is barred from his previous work as a plasterer due to his injury and is retraining to be a social worker.

The worst thing for many survivors is the uncertainty; some who are likely to be among the most severely affected do not yet know the outcomes of their medical situations.

“We need to think about people who have bullet particles in their body, because if that bullet particle shifts, they could need emergency surgery,” says Basharati, who believes more work should be done to track the victims and their needs. “I mean, I get that this is the first time New Zealand has been going through something like this. But we’re not idiots.”

One of those whose future is in limbo is Ahmed Jahangir, the chairman of Linwood mosque – the second the gunman attacked – who is a good-humoured man with his arm in a sling and big dimples when he smiles.

Jahangir, who was shot in the shoulder and has lost the use of his right hand, will not know for another year whether more treatment might help.

For now, someone else is running the Indian restaurant that was his pride and joy.He is full of praise for how government officials dealt with his case, but his future, and that of his young family and his business, are up in the air.

“As of now, I haven’t planned anything for the next year after this,” he says. “I’m just taking it as it comes. No certainty yet.”

## 67, Did she inspire or fail to deliver? Readers on how Jacinda Ardern will be remembered

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/24/readers-on-how-jacinda-ardern-will-be-remembered-as-new-zealand-prime-minister-pm

> Most praised New Zealand’s outgoing prime minister for her handling of crises, while others criticised her domestic policy record

Jacinda Ardern’s legacy has divided reader opinion. While many described the outgoing New Zealand prime minister as “inspirational” and praised her ability to manage a crisis, some responses also revealed anger at her handling of the Covid response and criticism for failure to deliver on promises.

Below is a selection of reader comments conveying the range of reactions when we asked the question: how will you remember Jacinda Ardern’s time as New Zealand PM.

When it comes to her response to the Christchurch mosque shootings and the White Island / Whakaari volcano disaster, Ardern, whose last official engagement is on Tuesday, was seen by many as a “crisis leader” and much admired.

“She has done a remarkable job as the prime minister. She will be remembered as a crisis leader – erupting volcano, global pandemic, terrorist attack ... She did unite us as a ‘team of five million’. She brought us closer together and navigated the country through one crisis after another.” Michal Chudzinski-Pawlowski, Auckland.

“The defining moment has to be the way she handled the Christchurch terror attack … She’s definitely up there with the best leaders to have ever scaled the heights of prime ministership.” Stephen Matich, Melbourne

On Covid, many welcomed the tough approach which in the first years of the pandemic saw New Zealand impose harsh restrictions and seal its borders.

“Very many thousands of people are alive and well today because of her and her government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.” Eileen Bowell, Hamilton.

“She saved thousands of lives during Covid when others could have cost us.” Michelle Bissenden, Dunedin.

However, others were unforgiving of the hardline stance. One reader, who wished to remain anonymous, wrote: “I missed giving my mother a hug before she died suddenly early 2021 due to Covid restrictions. The cost to so many New Zealanders of her draconian lockdown and management of [quarantine system] MIQ was unreasonable and breached our human rights.”

Esther Pocock, from Sweden, said Ardern “presided over a policy of rare cruelty and created divisions between Kiwis to maintain her hold”.

“She illegally locked approximately one million Kiwis out of their home country during one of the worst pandemics in living memory, leaving us to fend for ourselves and forcibly separating us from our families, and locked the rest of the country in.”

Some readers were critical of Ardern’s broader domestic policy record.

“The promise of more affordable housing has not been achieved; poverty among the poorest has not improved. There has been little progress on any reforms and so her legacy will be not remembered well.” Nick Gibson, New Zealand.

“She saved all her niceness for the world stage… She made a lot of promises and set a lot of goals and failed to fulfil any.” Mike ONeill, New Zealand.

Mike Richards, Hamilton, New Zealand, said Ardern “divided the nation”.

“She promised to prioritise child poverty, yet her policies made people poorer and created a major cost of living crisis … Her Covid policies kept children out of school for almost a year and now we have a ram-raiding crime crisis. She has led the most incompetent government we have ever had, capable of spending millions on committees and reports, but totally incapable of delivering anything.”

Yet most admired Ardern’s character and leadership style, with supporters regarding her as an inspirational leader.

Clint Baker, South Auckland, reflected on the “Jacinda effect”.

“I will remember Jacinda’s time in office as a time when New Zealanders could be proud of the reputation she gained for us around the world as a country. The ‘Jacinda effect’. I cannot recall any other leader, either here in NZ or in Australia having so many challenges during their time in office … Ardern’s responses were always well articulated with warmth and empathy.”

“She was an inspirational leader during a very difficult time; she was the right leader for the time; her compassion and understanding were so refreshing and an antidote to the unpleasant, divisive politics of some in this country and other parts of the world.” David McKenzie, New Zealand.

Dominic Hayes, Belgium said the 42-year-old “inspired a new generation of leaders”.

“A breath of fresh air in politics, genuine compassion, empathy and humanity, but tough when she needed to be.”

Some of the responses have been edited for brevity

‘An inspiring leader’: World reacts to Ardern’s resignation
The key moments of Ardern’s time as prime minister
Tell us: how will you remember Ardern’s time as New Zealand PM?


“Be strong, and be kind.” The prime minister’s words came at the close of a hastily scheduled press conference, announcing New Zealand’s first lockdown in the face of an unknown and deadly virus. For many New Zealanders, they became a catchphrase of the early pandemic, when the country succeeded in eliminating the coronavirus within its borders.

Over the coming years, they would also become synonymous with Jacinda Ardern’s politics – for her admirers, encapsulating a signature mixture of empathy and strength, and for critics, an example of soaring rhetoric not always backed by desired legislative reforms.

In 2017, Ardern became the world’s youngest serving female leader, and went on to make history as the second woman to give birth while holding elected office. Six years later, on Thursday, she made a shock announcement: she will step down at the close of the month, ending her two-term tenure before the next election in October.

Ardern’s emergence on to New Zealand’s political stage came just weeks before an election that Labour was near-universally expected to lose. “It was one of those rare moments where everything changed on the back of one force of personality,” says New Zealand political writer Toby Manhire. “When her rival, then-prime minister Bill English, spoke of her ‘stardust’ it was meant as an insult, but he was right.” On a wave of popularity dubbed “Jacindamania”, she led the party to scrape an against-the-odds victory.

Over the next six years, her leadership was shaped and defined by a series of national and international crises – and her responses in those pressured moments, which repeatedly emphasised the values of empathy, humanity and kindness, will likely form the standout legacy of her political career.

“She’s always been … a leader who is at their best in a crisis – and unfortunately, she has had her fair share,” says Madeleine Chapman, author of the unauthorised biography Jacinda Ardern: A New Kind of Leader.

In March 2019, some 18 months after Ardern’s election, New Zealand was hit by the worst terror attack in its history, when a white supremacist gunned down worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, killing 51. The words “they are us,” scrawled by Ardern on an A4 sheet of paper in the minutes after the attack, formed the centre of her speech that afternoon, embracing the immigrant and refugee communities targeted in the attack.

Images of her clad in a hijab, hugging a woman at the mosque circled the globe. Her political response – immediately denouncing the shooter as a terrorist and introducing bipartisan gun control legislation – came as a particularly sharp contrast to then-contemporary Donald Trump in the US. “The response to the terrorist attack … was just extraordinary,” says Manhire. “Empathetic, humane, but also steely, unflinching in fronting up to the uncomfortable issues it unearthed.” Those attributes would lay out a template for the most significant moments of Ardern’s leadership in the coming years.

“She has extremely good emotional intelligence – and that was really the quality that was needed, particularly during Christchurch, but also during the pandemic,” says political commentator Ben Thomas, a former staffer for the previous National government. In the first year of the pandemic, she successfully united New Zealanders behind extraordinary lockdowns to stamp out Covid-19 – a policy decision that resulted in New Zealand achieving some of the lowest rates of illness and death in the world.

That period won her enormous popularity, as well as “a global fame well out of proportion to New Zealand’s size”, Manhire says. In the overseas press, she shone bright – presenting a compelling poster child for progressive leadership in an era of growing fears about the rise of the far right, misinformation and the erosion of democratic norms.

At home, particularly as the pandemic years dragged on, her legacy and public image were more complex. Ardern’s government struggled to make headway on the housing crisis, which had led to huge numbers of people living on the streets, in cars, or in temporary accommodation. A vein of fiscal conservatism – ruling out a wealth tax or capital gains tax, and limiting tax take and spending – limited her government’s possibilities for large-scale, costly social programs beyond its Covid response. Despite major commitments on climate change, the country failed to meaningfully reduce its emissions.

On some of the issues closest to the prime minister’s heart, there were concrete legislative gains. Child poverty, the problem that she credited with spurring her into politics, has reduced across most measures in New Zealand, even amid the crisis of Covid 19 and the economic downturn it heralded. The government can tout core Labour victories for workers: record employment, 26 weeks of paid parental leave, increased sick leave, boosted bargaining power for low-wage sectors, the minimum wage up by over 30%. But the other reform efforts: to dramatically increase state housing numbers, revamp governance of ageing waterways, and settle on a mechanism to price agricultural emissions, have been mired in difficulty.

“When it came to designing and delivering complex legislation or sophisticated legislative reform, progress was much, much slower,” says Thomas. That mixed legacy reveals some of both the possibility and limitations of “be kind” as a guiding political principle. “The idea of kindness and empathy can hit its limits because politics is so often about tradeoffs,” Thomas says, particularly in the day-to-day struggles of governance, coalition-building and compromise.

As the pandemic continued, new challenges emerged: a small but highly vocal fringe of anti-vaccine and anti-mandate groups emerged, culminating in an explosion of violent riots on parliament’s lawns, and directing a toxic stream of death threats and violent rhetoric at the prime minister. High inflation and economic headwinds – many of them international in origin, but keenly felt in New Zealand – soured the mood of the general electorate, leading to a months-long downward slide for Ardern and Labour’s popularity. By late 2022, several successive polls had placed the centre-right National party as the most likely option to form a new government, alongside libertarian rightwing coalition partners Act.

The approaching election – now scheduled for October – was likely to be a far more gruelling battle than Ardern had ever faced previously. In 2017, she was chosen as Labour leader just weeks out from the election, leapfrogging the bitter months of campaign sparring. In the last general election in 2020, overwhelming support for the Covid response swept Labour to a near-unprecedented victory. From her early days in the political arena Ardern had always expressed a distaste for the bitter scrapping and point-scoring associated with political contests, says Chapman. “She had always said that she didn’t like that kind of type of politics, that type of campaigning. That’s exactly what this election was going to be – so I’m not surprised that she was not feeling incredibly enthusiastic about it.”

And there were other factors at play. After six years of crises and calamities, Ardern had run out of gas. “I know there’ll be much discussion in the aftermath of this decision as to what the so called ‘real reason’ was. I can tell you that what I’m sharing today is the only interesting angle that you will find - that after going on six years of some big challenges, I am human,” she said. “I know what this job takes, and I know that I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice. It’s that simple.”

Her daughter Neve, whom Ardern famously held as an infant at the United Nations general assembly, is now about to start school. Ardern said on Thursday that her family had made the biggest sacrifices of all. Drawing her remarks to a close, she addressed them directly. “Neve: mum is looking forward to being there when you start school this year. And to Clarke: let’s finally get married.”

As she announced her resignation – her voice occasionally cracking with emotion, Ardern returned again to the principles that formed the central pillars of her tenure.

“I hope I leave New Zealanders with a belief that you can be kind, but strong, empathetic but decisive, optimistic but focused,” she said. “And that you can be your own kind of leader – one who knows when it’s time to go.”

## 69, Christchurch attacks: New Zealand brings in sweeping gun-law changes

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/21/new-zealand-brings-in-sweeping-gun-law-changes-in-wake-of-christchurch-attacks

> Bans on assault rifles and military-style semi-automatics introduced as well as a buyback scheme

Assault rifles and military-style semi-automatics have been banned in New Zealand after Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, announced sweeping and immediate changes to gun laws following the Christchurch mosque shootings.

“I absolutely believe there will be a common view amongst New Zealanders, those who use guns for legitimate purposes, and those who have never touched one, that the time for the mass and easy availability of these weapons must end. And today they will,” said Ardern.

Parts that are used to convert guns into military-style semi-automatics (MSSAs) have also being banned, along with high-capacity magazines and parts that cause a firearm to generate semi-automatic, automatic or close-to-automatic gunfire.

“In short, every semi-automatic weapon used in the terrorist attack on Friday will be banned in this country,” said Ardern.

The ban on the sale of the weapons came into effect at 3pm on Thursday – the time of the press conference announcing the ban – with the prime minister warning that “all sales should now cease” of the weapons.

Ardern also directed officials to develop a gun-buyback scheme for those who already own such weapons. She said “fair and reasonable compensation” would be paid.

The buyback scheme is estimated to cost between NZ$100m and NZ$200m (£52m-£105m). Ardern said the government was still working out how to fund it.

New Zealand, a country of fewer than 5 million people, has an estimated 1.2-1.5m firearms. The number of MSSA weapons is not known, but there are 13,500 firearms that require the owner to have an E-category licence, which the government is using to estimate the number of MSSAs.

Stuart Nash, the minister of police, said they had “no idea” how many assault rifles were in circulation.

“It’s part of the problem,” said Nash. “The prime minister gave a figure for the buyback [cost]; the reason there’s such a large gap is we have no idea. We have an indicative set of numbers around MSSAs.”

“To owners who have legitimate uses for their guns, I want to reiterate that the actions being announced today are not because of you and are not directed at you,” Ardern said. “Our actions, on behalf of all New Zealanders, are directed at making sure this never happens again.”

The measures were praised internationally, with Rebecca Peters, who helped lead the successful campaign to reform Australia’s gun laws in the 1990s, saying: “It’s been the fastest response ever by a government after a tragedy.”

Sandy Hook happened 6 years ago and we can’t even get the Senate to hold a vote on universal background checks w/ #HR8.Christchurch happened, and within days New Zealand acted to get weapons of war out of the consumer market.This is what leadership looks like ⬇️ https://t.co/TcdR63anBt

The US senator Bernie Sanders said: “This is what real action to stop gun violence looks like.” He called on the US to follow New Zealand’s lead.

Dana Loesch, a spokesperson for the US National Rifle Association (NRA), responded to Sanders on Twitter saying: “The US isn’t NZ. While they do not have an inalienable right to bear arms and to self-defense, we do.”

The announcement was welcomed by the New Zealand opposition leader Simon Bridges, who said his National party would “work constructively with the government” on the issue.

“We agree that the public doesn’t need access to military-style semi-automatic weapons. National supports them being banned along with assault rifles,” he said.

The Green party co-leader and the Police Association also welcomed the changes.

“These are weapons that have been used to slaughter innocent children, women and men while they were at their most vulnerable – at prayer. It is a move we, as a community, can be proud of,” said Chris Cahill, president of the Police Association.

New Zealand’s police commissioner, Mike Bush, urged people to surrender to police any weapons that had been reclassified as illegal.

Police are asking people to contact them online to register firearms they need to surrender. Those who prefer not to do this online can call 0800 311 311. Bush urged New Zealanders not to walk into a police station carrying their weapon without calling ahead and warning police first.

“The first step is to encourage people to do it voluntarily,” said Bush. “I’m sure that the majority of people will do so. We will then be working with people to ascertain if they haven’t complied and once that period of grace or amnesty goes those people can, and in all likelihood will be prosecuted.”

One of the challenges facing New Zealand as it seeks to close loopholes in its gun laws and recover the now-banned weapons, is that it does not have a centralised register of guns in circulation.

A second series of reforms will be presented to cabinet on Monday, including issues such as licensing, registration and storage.

Ardern said the immediate changes were intended to take out of circulation the guns that were “most critical to be addressed urgently”.

“There are a range of other amendments that we believe do need to be made and that will be the second tranche of reforms, yet to come.”

Given the urgency of the legislation, Ardern said there would be a shortened select-committee process for the legislation and that she expected the amendments to the Arms Act to be passed within the next session of parliament on Monday.

## 70, Ardern is right not to name the Christchurch suspect. What about everyone else?

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/19/naming-christchurch-suspect-media-jacinda-ardern-name

> Jacinda Ardern won’t speak his name. Reporters and politicians must reflect on whether they are fuelling propaganda

DON’T say his name.

Don’t share the livestreamed video of the killings, don’t read that rambling adolescent nonsense of a manifesto, don’t fill newspaper front pages with stories about his childhood. Ever since news broke of the terror attack on two Christchurch mosques, there have been calls to deny the suspect attention in favour of focusing on victims and survivors – and now New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has put her moral authority behind them.

She will not, she said in parliament, publicly use his name: “He is a terrorist. He is a criminal. He is an extremist. But he will, when I speak, be nameless.”

Obviously, there is a limit to what such a decision can realistically achieve. Everything about the manifesto, with its jarring in-jokes and knowing winks to meme culture, suggests that its writer and potential audience couldn’t care less what some liberal woman politician says. An online subculture of angry inadequates flooded the internet with repeated uploads of that gruesome film. At times, a new upload was being posted every second to YouTube, while Facebook took down 1.5m of them in the first day. It is easy to look at those numbers and despair; to feel that mainstream culture is increasingly powerless against, and irrelevant to, the sort of people who would obsessively share a film of fellow humans dying.

Yet to strip a man of his identity against his will can be a powerful thing, all the more so given that it’s more usually done to women.

The Canadian film about sex trafficking She Has a Name took its title from a grassroots campaign against the dehumanising of victims (the story goes that it originally came from an exchange between a pimp and a customer – when the man asked the name of the girl he was buying, the answer was: “She doesn’t have a name. She is whatever you want her to be.”) We recognise it as grossly belittling, too, when a murder victim is reduced to an afterthought in the coverage of her own death, which is why headlines (and depressingly sometimes whole articles) about the Oscar Pistorius murder trial caused such offence when they failed to name his dead girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. The hashtag #SayHerName is used to draw attention to black female victims of police brutality precisely because giving someone a name and a face creates an emotional connection to them. For Ardern to withdraw that privilege from the man about to go on trial in New Zealand may be a symbolic gesture, but it’s not an entirely empty one.

It shouldn’t be confused with refusing to examine how the suspect may have been radicalised, what clues there may have been in his past behaviour or what lessons could be learned to prevent future tragedies. That’s serious, painstaking work that will go on regardless of whether two words are uttered in public or not.

What Ardern has done differs, too, from Margaret Thatcher’s attempt to deny some republican and loyalist groups the oxygen of publicity by banning the broadcasting of figures associated with them during the Troubles. There is no compulsion here. Ardern didn’t decree that the media must follow her example, although inevitably her decision puts some moral pressure on the New Zealand press in particular. But it should prompt journalists the world over to reflect carefully on how they cover a trial the defendant may hope to turn into a self-aggrandising circus.

The principle of open justice means it would be wrong for the alleged perpetrator of a crime not to be named the minute his identity is known. It is the legitimate work of journalists, too, to report on trials without fear of censorship and to investigate the background to a crime. Sometimes terrorists look more powerful hidden behind a balaclava than they might do if you ripped the mask off, exposing the often pathetic reality behind a carefully cultivated myth.

It is also our job, however, to tell complex stories in a way that remains faithful to the facts but avoids unnecessarily feeding the propaganda beast. That’s a difficult editorial balancing act but no different from the ethical considerations raised by Islamic State, whose grotesque beheading videos were calculated to expand their sphere of political and emotional influence beyond their limited physical territory. Ardern has chosen her own way of cutting the suspect down to size. Now what about the rest of us?

## 71, World leaders condemn 'sickening' terrorism in New Zealand

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/world-leaders-condemn-sickening-terrorism-in-new-zealand

> Leaders offer support to victims of mosque attacks and criticise rise of Islamophobia

Christchurch shooting: latest updates


As news of the terrorist atrocities in Christchurch spread, political leaders around the world expressed their sorrow, shock and anger at what the country’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, called “one of New Zealand’s darkest days”.

Donald Trump expressed his “warmest sympathy and best wishes” to the people of New Zealand after “the horrible massacre in the mosques”. The US president tweeted that “innocent people have so senselessly died” and added: “The US stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all!”

The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, described the attack as a “vicious act of hate” and said the US stood in solidarity with the people of New Zealand.

The British prime minister Theresa May called the assault, which killed at least 49 people and left dozens more injured, a “horrifying terrorist attack”.

“To target Muslims as they were attending their place of worship is despicable,” May said. “There can be no place in our societies for the vile ideology that drives and incites hatred and fear. Together we will defeat those who seek to destroy our values, our way of life and seek to divide us.”

Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, ordered flags to be flown at half-mast in the aftermath of the attack. “I condemn the violent, extremist, rightwing terrorist attack that has stolen the lives of so many innocent New Zealanders as they went about their peaceful practice of worship at their mosques in Christchurch today,” he said.

One of Ardern’s predecessors, Helen Clark, said she was “in a state of shock” about what had happened in a country renowned for its peacefulness.

“This isn’t the NZ we know and love. It’s an unprecedented attack. Deepest sympathies to families. RIP,” she tweeted.

The United Nations secretary general António Guterres reiterated “the urgency of working better together globally to counter Islamophobia and eliminate intolerance and violent extremism in all its forms”, a spokesman said.

Two of the most high-profile leaders in the Muslim world offered their sympathies but pointed out that the attacks had occurred in a climate of increasing Islamophobia.

“I strongly condemn the terror attack against Al Noor mosque in New Zealand and Muslim worshippers,” said Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “May Allah have mercy on the victims and grant a speedy recovery to the wounded.

He added: “On behalf of my country, I offer my condolences to the Islamic world and the people of New Zealand, who have been targeted by this deplorable act – the latest example of rising racism and Islamophobia.”

Imran Khan, who was elected prime minister of Pakistan last summer, said the attacks confirmed what he had always maintained: “that terrorism does not have a religion”.

However, Khan said Muslims worldwide had found themselves targeted and “demonised” since the 9/11 attacks on the US. “I blame these increasing terror attacks on the current Islamophobia post-9/11 where Islam and 1.3 bn Muslims have collectively been blamed for any act of terror by a Muslim,” he tweeted. “This has been done deliberately to also demonise legitimate Muslim political struggles.”

Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, also tweeted that bigotry in western countries had led to the attacks and criticised the west for “defending [the] demonisation of Muslims as ‘freedom of expression’”.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, offered his solidarity.

“All our thoughts are with the victims of the heinous crimes against the mosques of Christchurch, New Zealand, and with their loved ones,” he said. “France stands against all forms of extremism and acts with its partners against terrorism in the world.”

The Spanish government said it “forcefully condemns” the attacks.

“As well as wishing a swift recovery to the injured, the government offers its most sincere condolences to the friends and relatives of the victims, as well as to the people and government of New Zealand, a close ally in the shared fight against extremism and terrorism,” it said in a statement.

## 72, Jacinda Ardern resigns as prime minister of New Zealand

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/19/jacinda-ardern-resigns-as-prime-minister-of-new-zealand

> Labour leader to stand down no later than 7 February, saying she ‘no longer had enough in the tank’ to do the job

Tell us: how will you remember Jacinda Ardern’s time as PM?


New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said she is resigning, in an unexpected announcement that came as she confirmed a national election for October.

At the party’s first caucus meeting of the year on Thursday, Ardern said she “no longer had enough in the tank” to do the job. “It’s time,” she added.

“I’m leaving, because with such a privileged role comes responsibility – the responsibility to know when you are the right person to lead and also when you are not. I know what this job takes. And I know that I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice. It’s that simple,” she said.

Her term as prime minister will conclude no later than 7 February but she will continue as an MP until the election this year.

“I am human, politicians are human. We give all that we can for as long as we can. And then it’s time. And for me, it’s time,” she said.

Ardern said she had reflected over the summer break on whether she had the energy to continue in the role, and had concluded she did not.

Ardern became the world’s youngest female head of government when she was elected prime minister in 2017 at 37. She has led New Zealand through the Covid-19 pandemic, and a series of disasters including the terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, and the White Island volcanic eruption.

“This has been the most fulfilling five and a half years of my life. But it’s also had its challenges – among an agenda focused on housing, child poverty and climate change, we encountered a … domestic terror event, a major natural disaster, a global pandemic, and an economic crisis,” she said.

Asked how she would like New Zealanders to remember her leadership, Ardern said “as someone who always tried to be kind”.

“I hope I leave New Zealanders with a belief that you can be kind, but strong, empathetic but decisive, optimistic but focused. And that you can be your own kind of leader – one who knows when it’s time to go,” Ardern said.

Over the past year, Ardern has faced a significant increase in threats of violence, particularly from conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine groups infuriated by the country’s vaccine mandates and lockdowns. She said, however, that the increased risk associated with the job were not behind her decision to step down.

“I don’t want to leave the impression that the adversity you face in politics is the reason that people exit. Yes, it does have an impact. We are humans after all, but that was not the basis of my decision,” she said.

Ardern said she had no future plans, other than to spend more time with her family.

She thanked her partner, Clarke Gayford, and daughter Neve, whom she gave birth to while holding office, as “the ones that have sacrificed the most out of all of us”.

“To Neve: Mum is looking forward to being there when you start school this year. And to Clarke – let’s finally get married.”

The prime minister’s announcement came as a shock to many New Zealanders. During a brief flurry of speculation over Ardern’s possible resignation in late 2022, the prime minister said she had no intention of doing so. In the weeks leading up to Thursday’s announcement, there were no clues or leaks to suggest her resignation was on the cards.

The news arrives as New Zealand enters a closely fought election year, with the date of the vote announced for 14 October. Polling over recent months had placed the Ardern-led Labour party slightly behind the opposition National.

Ardern said her decline in the polls did not prompt her decision to leave.

“I’m not leaving because I believe we can’t win the election, but because I believe we can and will, and we need a fresh set of shoulders for that challenge,” she said.

Who will replace Ardern is not yet clear: the deputy leader and finance minister, Grant Robertson, who would be considered a frontrunner, said on Thursday that he would not be seeking the position.“I am not putting myself forward to be a candidate for the leadership of the Labour party,” he said.

The Labour caucus has seven days to find out whether a new candidate holds more than two-thirds of support within caucus to become the new leader and prime minister. A caucus vote for a new leader will take place on 22 January. If no one meets that threshold level of support, the leadership contest will go to the wider Labour membership.

The National leader, Christopher Luxon, said Ardern had “made a significant contribution to New Zealand, in what is a difficult and demanding job” and called her a “strong ambassador for New Zealand on the world stage”.

“Her leadership in the aftermath of the Christchurch terror attacks was simultaneously strong and compassionate, and is something she can be proud of,” he added.

The prime minister of Australia, Anthony Albanese, paid tribute to Ardern, saying she “has shown the world how to lead with intellect and strength … She has demonstrated that empathy and insight are powerful leadership qualities.”

## 73, How to report terrorism: name, but don’t amplify

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/24/report-terrorism-jacinda-ardern-christchurch-guardian

> Jacinda Ardern honorably refuses to name the Christchurch suspect, but the Guardian has decided that the duty of journalists is different

In one of several impressive acts of leadership, New Zealand’s parliament opened last Tuesday with the Speaker inviting an imam to lead prayers, first in Arabic then English. In Hansard the last of these “verses of patience” reads: “Oh Lord, we ask you to protect New Zealand and the whole world from such calamities. Amen.”

Would we be better protected if journalists followed the urging of New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern and did not name the perpetrators of acts of terrorism? We can acknowledge her skilful and empathetic response to the shooting of scores of people at two Christchurch mosques on 15 March. We can recognise that Ardern’s purpose as prime minister was rightly to turn the focus on those lost and mourned. But is she correct in implying that acts of terror will be deterred if no one speaks the names of perpetrators? Can, should, notoriety – as distinct from glorification or anti-hero status – be denied?

Many think so, including the UK’s head of counter-terrorism policing, Neil Basu, who in an open letter challenged editors to debate how they cover terrorism, arguing that the problem goes beyond the social media platforms where perpetrators can by themselves disseminate live their crimes and manifestos. Though the Guardian, like most professional media outlets, did not circulate the Christchurch shooter’s video or screed, readers wrote to me to admonish the paper for continuing to refer to the accused shooter by name. Copy Ardern, they urged.

I asked the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, for her response, and she replied: “The role of a news organisation is different from the role of a politician or a political party; our responsibility is to report the facts, contextualise events, and work with our readers to understand what’s going on. Not reporting the terrorist’s name would undermine those efforts. However, we do think it’s important to ensure that the terrorist’s identity is not overly represented in our coverage, and that our coverage also focuses on the victims.”

I agree with Viner. The fundamental task of journalism is to try to reflect society to itself, especially the aspects that do harm unless they are understood and faced. The ignorance and bigotry that underlie most terrorism breed in the dark and feed on paranoia. Rumour and conspiracy thrive in closed information loops. Professional journalism, by circulating verified information and giving context, breaks them open. If journalists choose to be silent, conspiracists fill the void and turn the silence to their purposes.

Suppression of information about the identity, acts and motivations of a terrorist is a self-defeating defensive crouch. Stand up and defy haters and killers, as have large numbers of people in New Zealand and other communities where terrorism has occurred. We underestimate ourselves grossly if we behave as though the decency of the majority of people in our diverse and intermingling societies is so fragile that the diatribes of odd individuals can overwhelm it. Scrutiny exposes the oddness, the isolation and the smallness of these individuals. Context gives perspective and combats fear.

Due process, applied to a specific individual, has purposes. When appropriate, communities name and shame. Notoriety is not in itself anything of value. The wrongdoer, though known, is powerless. Through open justice, we judge, and remind ourselves of what is damagingly aberrant.

In these strange times, when truth is under attack and populism’s deceits beckon, the strengths of liberal democracies – elected leaders who can unify, police on lawful guard, journalists striving to inform, courts open, each in their proper sphere – are essential.

Be confident that our communities can be exposed to the facts about how and why a dreadful crime was committed, without tending toward either paralysing fearfulness or mindless emulation.

## 74, Jacinda Ardern urges Musk to ‘stick to transparency’ amid extremism fears

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/01/jacinda-ardern-urges-musk-to-stick-to-transparency-amid-extremism-fears

> New Zealand PM says Twitter’s role in her push to rid the world of extremist and terrorist content online was now in ‘unknown territory’

The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has called for Elon Musk to take on the “huge responsibility” of controlling a social media platform and “stick strongly to the principle of transparency”, after the billionaire took control of Twitter.

Ardern was speaking at a summit on national security, disinformation and online extremism when she was asked about Musk’s purchase of the company and his recent online behaviour.

“While I haven’t had any opportunity to engage directly with Mr Musk, the point that I would make is that social media and platforms like Twitter have a huge responsibility. They can be a force for democracy, a force for connection and for good. But also, if misused, they can do a huge amount of harm,” Ardern said.

“My hope would be that he would stick strongly to the principle of transparency. Because that is one of the things that he has claimed he is focused on. We are too.”

In her speech at the counter-terrorism summit, Ardern said online disinformation was a top concern for New Zealanders, with one in four saying disinformation was the greatest security threat to them and their families. “We are particularly concerned about the challenge of disinformation as we see this exacerbating a number of national security issues,” Ardern said.

“It is impacting liberal democracies worldwide, eroding trust in institutions, and our ability to respond to it as a society is being tested.”

After the March 15 mosque terror attacks, where a white supremacist killed 51 Muslims worshipping in Christchurch in 2019, Ardern launched the “Christchurch Call”, asking social media companies to counter online extremism and misinformation. The mosque attack was livestreamed on multiple social media platforms, and the terrorist’s manifesto published online. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey had supported Ardern’s “Christchurch Call”, and the platform has been a partner with the initiative.

“Twitter is one of the organisations that has been deeply involved in the Christchurch Call to Action and – to date – been a really constructive partner,” Ardern said. She went on to say that the partnership was now in “unknown territory”.

Musk, the world’s richest man, completed his purchase of Twitter for $44bn (£38bn) last week. The takeover by the self-described “free speech absolutist” has prompted concerns from advocates and world leaders that the company would roll back safety and content moderation rules and bring back extremist or banned accounts. Musk has appointed himself CEO and dissolved its board of directors.

Shortly after Musk took the helm of the company, the accounts of Britain First, an extreme group whose leader has spent time in jail for hate crimes against Muslims, rejoined the social media network. It had been banned in 2017 under Twitter’s hate speech rules after posting inflammatory anti-Muslim videos. Earlier this year Musk said he would reverse the ban on Donald Trump’s account. Trump’s account was suspended in January 2021, after the storming of the Capitol, with the company citing breaches of its rules and concerns over “further incitement of violence”.

Musk was criticised on Sunday after posting a baseless conspiracy theory about the assault of Paul Pelosi, husband of Nancy Pelosi, to Twitter. He later deleted the tweet.

## 75, Christchurch shooting suspect will face 50 murder charges, say New Zealand police

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/04/christchurch-shooting-suspect-will-face-50-charges-say-new-zealand-police

> Australian Brenton Tarrant will also face 39 attempted murder charges as MPs hear submissions on gun law changes

The Australian man accused of killing 50 Muslim worshippers in gun attacks on two mosques in Christchurch will face 50 murder charges and 39 attempted murder charges, New Zealand police said on Thursday.

“Other charges are still under consideration,” police said in a statement.

Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, was previously charged with only one murder following the attack and has been remanded without a plea.

He is due back in court on Friday. The attack on 15 March was the worst mass shooting by a lone gunman in New Zealand.

The news came as MPs heard oral submissions on the government’s gun law reform bill, which seeks to ban military-style semi-automatics (MSSAs) and assault rifles and related components, and arrange a buyback scheme for guns that become illegal.

The law is being overhauled after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern promised action in the wake of the mosque shootings, and thousands of written submissions have already been received.

David Tipple, the owner of Gun City, a shop that sold the alleged Christchurch attacker four weapons, told MPs that a buyback scheme could cost $726m, rather than the amount suggested by ministers, which has been between $100m and $300m.

After questioning from Labour MP Michael Wood on the Muslim community’s right to feel safe, Tipple said: “This wasn’t about killing people. It was about dividing people.”

Earlier, Mustafa Farouk, president of the Federation of Islamic Associations NZ, told MPs: “I’m here to represent some of those people who are not able to here because they are dead.”

Fellow federation member Rehanna Ali said the attack had given impetus to gun reform measures. “We want to reclaim the country we had before March 15 ... the outpouring of compassion, of shared grief ... has gone a great way towards reclaiming who we are, and this legislation will continue on that path.”

Andrew Gilchrist, who oversaw the buyback scheme in New South Wales in Australia after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, told the hearing that the programme faced issues after people all over the country started handing them in. One person had even handed in a World War II-era bazooka.

Responding to claims parliament was rushing the law change, Police Association president Chris Cahill said successive governments had already failed to address the issue. “Is it time to act? Are we being to quick? No, we’ve been far too slow,” he said.

The final submission came from Christchurch mayor Lianne Dalziel. She told the committee that she sat where they were after the 1990 Aramoana killings, in which 13 people were shot dead. However, the minister back then wasn’t able to gather enough support to ban military-style weapons.

Dalziel said she had read back over the records of those hearings and said it was very distressing it in the context of the Christchurch attack. “The law change must happen without delay,” she said.

The government wants to pass gun reform legislation by Thursday next week.

In a surprise announcement, Jacinda Ardern has said she is stepping down as prime minister.

Ardern became the world’s youngest female head of government when she was elected prime minister in 2017 at age 37, and said her time in office have been the “most fulfilling five-and-a-half years of my life”.

Recently, her leadership has been dominated by her handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, but she also led New Zealand through major disasters including the terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch, and the White Island volcanic eruption.

She became something of a global celebrity figure for her crisis management skills, but more recently her domestic popularity has waned. Last month, she pledged to pare back her agenda as election year approached, and over the past year, her party’s polling slumped amid concerns about the cost of living, the economy, and crime.

## 77, Christchurch mosque attacks: suspect charged with 'terrorist act'

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/21/christchurch-mosque-attacks-suspect-charged-with-terrorist-act

> New Zealand police add terrorism charge to existing murder and attempted murder charges against Brenton Tarrant

Brenton Tarrant has been charged by New Zealand police with engaging in a “terrorist act”, in addition to existing murder charges over the two mosque attacks in Christchurch in March.

The Australian man, who was arrested for his alleged involvement in the shooting deaths of 51 people, was previously charged with 50 counts of murder and 39 counts of attempted murder, though New Zealand police said other charges were under consideration.

Police met with more than 200 people, including survivors of the 15 March Christchurch attack and the families of victims to inform them of the new charges.

“A charge of engaging in a Terrorist Act under section 6A of the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 has now been filed against Brenton Tarrant,” said a statement from New Zealand police.

“The charge will allege that a terrorist act was carried out in Christchurch on 15 March 2019 and follows consultation between Police, Crown Law and the Christchurch Crown Solicitors Office.”

An additional murder charge and two additional attempted murder charges were also filed against him, meaning the suspect will face 51 charges of murder, 40 of attempted murder and one charge under the Terrorism Suppression Act.

The 15 March was the worst mass shooting by a lone gunman in the country and prompted sweeping reforms to New Zealand gun laws. The country’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern, along with French president Emmanuel Macron, also met to discuss a plan, named the “Christchurch Call”, to eliminate terrorist and violent content online.

## 78, 'It's not fair to blame us': aisles at Gun City are busy in wake of Christchurch attack

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/17/its-not-fair-to-blame-us-aisles-at-gun-city-are-busy-in-wake-of-christchurch-attack

> As prime minister Jacinda Ardern considers banning semi-automatic rifles, some gun users are busy stockpiling

On a gloomy, grey Sunday at Gun City in Christchurch business is booming, with the large, warehouse-style shop humming with more than two dozen customers.

As prime minister Jacinda Ardern considers banning semi-automatic rifles following Friday’s massacre of 50 Muslim worshippers, some gun users are busy stockpiling, fearing their favourite toys will soon be out of reach.

An employee who works at a takeaway shop opposite Gun City, New Zealand’s largest gun retailer, confirmed to the Guardian that business had been “extremely busy” at the rifle store since Friday’s massacre. She said she only usually saw such crowds at the shop’s annual sale.

The employee said despite every other shop going into lockdown during the three-hour event, the doors of Gun City remained open. As police chased the killer and ambulances rushed to attend the injured and dying, streams of buyers entered the doors of Gun City carrying empty rifle bags.

“It was disturbing,” she says.

Gun City has been contacted for comment.

Among the throngs shopping there on Sunday was a former New Zealand soldier who gave his name as Anthony, browsing for bullets. A tall, strong man with a ginger beard and tattoos, Anthony says he uses his riflefor “sport”. He was hoping semi-automatics were not banned, but he and his shooting friends were buying the weapons, which can cost anything from NZ$600 (US$400) upwards.

“I felt anger because I knew it would create a negative tidal wave towards people like me, it creates panic. People see a gun now and they freak out.” says Anthony, who also condemned the attack.

“We have had these guns available for a long time and we very rarely have a situation like this. It’s only because the 1% of people. It’s not fair to blame or to ridicule us, the people who do follow the rules. I don’t think it is fair. I think we are still a safe place.”

At a press conference in Wellington on Sunday, Ardern said she would discuss tightening gun access with her cabinet on Monday, and planned to “verify” information that some New Zealanders were stockpiling weapons.

However Ardern was very clear that New Zealand’s gun laws would change in the wake of the massacre – the same message she has reiterated over and over since hours after the first shots were fired.

“I can tell you one thing right now: our gun laws will change,” said Ardern on Friday. “There have been attempts to change our laws in 2005, 2012 and after an inquiry in 2017. Now is the time for change.”

Rick, another customer at Gun City on Sunday afternoon, said he wanted modified semi-automatic rifles to be banned. There was no reason for anyone to purchase them besides “looking cool”, said Rick, who hunts deer.

“They are far too strong for hunters, they will rip any animal to shreds,” said Rick, who was dressed in a camoflage-style shirt, cap and sunglasses,

Civilians in New Zealand own an estimated 1.2m firearms, according to the 2017 small arms survey. That makes New Zealand’s per capita rate of gun ownership higher than Australia’s, but still far below the US, where there is more than one gun per person.

The country’s gun laws are largely unchanged since 1992, when controls were tightened after the 1990 Aramoana massacre, in which a man killed 13 people with a semi-automatic rifle.

## 79, Jacinda Ardern becomes a dame as New Zealand honours former PM

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/05/jacinda-ardern-dame-grand-companion-kings-birthday-awards-former-new-zealand-pm-prime-minister

> Ardern, who said she felt conflicted about the honour, was recognised for her service to the country during the pandemic and Christchurch terror attacks

New Zealand has awarded Jacinda Ardern one of the country’s highest honours, making the former prime minister a dame for her service to the country during the Covid-19 pandemic and Christchurch terror attacks.

Ardern accepted the honour but said she had felt conflicted about doing so. “I was in two minds about accepting this acknowledgment. So many of the things we went through as a nation over the last five years were about all of us rather than one individual,” she said.

“But I have heard that said by so many Kiwis who I have encouraged to accept an honour over the years. And so for me this is a way to say thank you – to my family, to my colleagues, and to the people who supported me to take on the most challenging and rewarding role of my life.”

The former leader’s tenure was marked by a series of national and international crises, and the prime minister, Chris Hipkins, said the recognition was for her leadership during these “periods of intense challenge”. In particular, it recognised her response after a white supremacist gunman killed 50 Muslims at prayer at a mosque in Christchurch, and her pandemic leadership, which saw New Zealand achieve very high rates of vaccination and some of the lowest excess death rates in the world.

“Dame Jacinda Ardern is recognised for her service to New Zealand during some of the greatest challenges our country has faced in modern times,” Hipkins said.

“Leading New Zealand’s response to the 2019 terrorist attacks and to the Covid-19 pandemic represented periods of intense challenge for our 40th prime minister, during which time I saw first-hand that her commitment to New Zealand remained absolute.”

Since her surprise resignation in January, Ardern has kept a relatively low public profile. She has accepted a role as special envoy to the prime minister to continue work on responses to online extremism and terrorism; joined the board of Prince William’s Earthshot prize, which awards responses to environmental crises; and accepted fellowships to Harvard University.

The country announced its king’s birthday honours on Monday, a public holiday to recognise King Charles III. Also recognised was Queen Camilla, who was awarded a New Zealand order of merit for her support of the monarch. It is traditional in New Zealand to recognise the monarch’s spouse for their service.

The country gave out 182 honours in total, including three other dames, and three knights. Recipients included Māori leaders, sports coaches, doctors, journalists, arts advocates, business leaders and others.

Good morning, I’m Mattha Busby with today’s essential stories.

New Zealand has suffered the worst mass shooting in its history 49 people killed in attacks targeting Muslims at two mosques in the city of Christchurch. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, described the atrocity as a terrorist attack and said Friday had been one of New Zealand’s darkest days. A man in his late 20s has been arrested and charged with murder. Police haven’t named him, but a man identifying himself as Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old born in Australia, broadcast livestream footage on Facebook of him driving to a mosque, entering and shooting randomly at people inside.

Ideology. The suspected gunman published a “manifesto” outlining his motivations in which he espoused far-right and anti-immigrant views.

City in shock. The mayor of Christchurch, Lianne Dalziel, said: “This has come as a bolt from the blue ... It just feels like it’s not what would happen in a place like New Zealand.”

Hundreds of thousands of children in more than 100 countries are skipping school in a global strike to urge politicians and corporations to take concrete action against climate change, a year after the movement began when the teenager Greta Thunberg held a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament. More than 1,600 climate strike events are planned worldwide.

Why? A number of young climate activists have written letters for the Guardian explaining their motives for today’s strike. “The climate alarm has sounded, and the time has come for us all to realise that there is still time to act,” one said.

Brexit is likely to be delayed by at least three months after the UK parliament overwhelmingly opted to ask the EU for an extension to article 50, which set a withdrawal date of 29 March. Splits in Theresa May’s cabinet were again exposed when eight ministers were among a majority of Tory MPs who unsuccessfully voted to effectively keep the threat of no deal in place, in contravention of the government’s motion. The European council president, Donald Tusk, tweeted that he would appeal to EU states to allow a long extension, and it is likely they will acquiesce.

“She didn’t listen .. to my ideas on how to negotiate it,” Donald Trump said as he renewed his criticism of May’s handling of Brexit. He also said he regretted how the issue was “tearing a country apart”.

Trump threatened to use his presidential veto for the first time after the US Senate voted to overturn his declaration last month of a national emergency in order to divert billions of taxpayer funds to build his long-promised US-Mexico border wall without congressional approval. In a rare move, 12 Republican senators joined the Democrats to vote 59-41 to block the president’s manoeuvre. Soon after the vote, Trump tweeted: “VETO!”

‘Unconstitutional’. The Kansas senator Jerry Moran, a Republican, said he believed “the use of emergency powers in this circumstance violates the constitution” and would edge the US closer towards “the path of an all-powerful executive”.

Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, who is gay, said people should not be judged by their sexual orientation following a St Patrick’s Day breakfast at US vice-president Mike Pence’s residence. Varadkar made his comments in the presence of a conservative Christian once called “the face of anti-LGBTQ hate in America”.

A French gynaecologists’ union has threatened to halt abortions in an attempt to force the government to meet doctors in a dispute over what it claims is a lack of insurance funds for colleagues convicted of medical errors.

The US House of Representatives voted unanimously to demand the full findings of Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation be made public in a symbolic action designed to pressure the attorney general, William Barr, to release as much information as possible when the inquiry ends.

## 81, Jacinda Ardern’s graceful departure is the personification of modern democratic ideals

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/19/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-pm-resignation-modern-democratic-ideals

> The New Zealand prime minister’s bold and resolute leadership neutralised hoary stereotypes that insisted female power is soft or weak

Jacinda Ardern has resigned as prime minister of New Zealand and will be leaving office on 7 February.

World leadership has rarely seen anything like her. The dignity and integrity of her departure strikes a paradoxically powerful note, especially at a time when political transition in democracies from the United States to Brazil has been marred by violence and insurrection.

The childhood Mormon who became the world leader of the International Union of Socialist Youth was elected leader of NZ Labour in 2017. Ardern subsequently became the world’s then-youngest elected national leader at the age of 37.

She returned to government a Labour party who many thought was condemned to an ongoing political wilderness by using “Jacindamania” to boost the Labour vote in 2017 into a politically adroit coalition with minor parties. She maintained elements of that coalition by grace even when she provided her party with a thumping outright majority in the “Jacindaslide” of 2020.

Over her five years of leadership she shepherded New Zealanders through the tragedy and aftermath of the Christchurch massacre, managed a pandemic that not only threatened lives but devastated key local industries and reckoned with the climate crisis in country already susceptible to natural disasters. Domestically, her leadership faced a housing crunch, the need to rebuild a tattered industrial relations system, eroded services and post-pandemic inflationary pressure. She also had a child while in office. In her resignation statement, Ardern said she had “nothing left in the tank”.

Unsurprising. Even though Ardern’s poll numbers had taken a recent battering, with complex domestic problems unresolved and a new leader of the opposition conservative National party with more charisma than the last, her political capacity to recover her party’s fortunes before New Zealand’s October election should not be discounted.

Beyond the image of the empathic, cosmopolitan leader who wore a deferent scarf to weep with the survivors of Christchurch, made jokes on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and turned up to Buckingham Palace in a Māori feathered cloak, Ardern was a shrewd political operator rumoured to dispatch rivals internal and external with a smiling blade.

She may have led New Zealand’s famous “wellbeing budgets” and praised kindness as a policy virtue but the ruthlessness required to ascend power anywhere was on rare display when a health minister from her own cabinet defied their government’s own pandemic restrictions during lockdown to go on a bicycle ride. Not only did Ardern publicly end his ministry, but kept him in representative purgatory, obliging him to do his job and complete immediate ministerial tasks before his fall from seniority.

The Harvard Political Review identified the rare leadership character of Ardern as “authentic, empathetic and bold”, and a powerful mash of political attributes once understood in gendered terms. “Throughout the 20th century, leaders rose to power by projecting traditionally masculine qualities like aggression and stubbornness to dominate their opposition,” it wrote, explaining the sexist paradigm Ardern deftly upended with wit. So powerful were the images of Ardern at home with partner and baby, talking through her own frustrations with harsh lockdown restrictions even though it was her own directive that enforced them, that many Australians chose to tune into them rather than the statements of our own national leadership.

Indeed, it’s not beyond possibility Ardern’s position in the Australian political imagination had an impact on our last election. First, she reaffirmed a traditional western Labour brand of pragmatic, unchaotic empathy that – despite the best efforts of her opposition – remained unscary and undemonisable. The clear example she exported of female capacity for bold and resolute leadership neutralised the hoary stereotypes that insisted female power was soft or weak. You can see her influence across Australia’s political spectrum – most deferentially, perhaps, in the ideologically unalike yet all-female Teals.

Australian Labor owes Ardern a debt, too. Her conspicuously polite visual horror in response to an uninvited hug from Australia’s former prime minister, Scott Morrison, affirmed that man’s image of arrogance and inauthenticity in the electorate in ways more devastating than the most skewering propaganda campaign or editorial.

Any leader’s political life is defined by its inevitable end. The times shift, the people’s demands change, the reality of unforeseen events overcomes even the most reasonable expectations of the future. It is the graceful reckoning that power will, can, must and – really – should be lost that is the robustness of our systems.

With her resignation, and the respectful manner of it, Jacinda Ardern’s departure from office crowns the political contribution she has made to her country and cements her personification of modern democratic ideals in our shared west and beyond.

Her moment of political power may be fading, but her status as an icon of democratic leadership is indelible.

## 82, ‘Broken-hearted but not broken’: Al Noor imam's Christchurch speech in full

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/22/broken-hearted-but-not-broken-al-noor-imams-christchurch-speech-in-full

> Imam thanks New Zealanders for ‘your tears, your haka, your love and compassion’

Imam Gamal Fouda of Al Noor mosque, who just a week ago watched as 42 people at his mosque were shot during Friday prayers, has delivered a moving address at the prayer service in Hagley Park, attended by thousands of people including prime minister Jacinda Ardern.

In the speech he said New Zealand was “broken-hearted but not broken” at the deaths of 50 people. He thanked the people of New Zealand for “your tears, your haka, your flowers and your love and compassion” and thanked Ardern “for holding our families close and honouring us with a simple scarf”.

Fouda also warned that “Islamophobia kills” and said the events in Christchurch did not come out of the blue but were fanned by “anti-Muslim rhetoric” from some politicians and some in the media.

The full text of his speech is here:

Brothers and sisters in Islam, brothers and sisters in humanity, brothers and sisters in New Zealand. Last Friday I stood in this mosque and saw hatred and rage in the eyes of the terrorist, who killed and martyred 50 people, wounded 42 and broke the hearts of millions around the world.

Today, from the same place, I look out and see the love and compassion in the eyes of thousands of fellow New Zealanders and fellow human beings from across the globe that fill the hearts of millions more who are not with us physically but in spirit.

This terrorist sought to tear our nation apart with an evil ideology that has torn the world apart. But, instead, we have shown that New Zealand is unbreakable. And that the world can see in us an example of love and unity. We are broken-hearted but we are not broken. We are alive. We are together. We are determined to not let anyone divide us.

We are determined to love one another and to support each other. This evil ideology of white supremacy did not strike us first, yet it has struck us hardest. The number of people killed is not extraordinary but the solidarity in New Zealand is extraordinary.

To the families of the victims, your loved ones did not die in vain. Their blood has watered the seeds of hope. Through them, the world will see the beauty of Islam and the beauty of our unity. Do not say of those who have been killed in the way of Allah that they are dead. They are alive, rejoicing with their Lord.

They were the best of us, taken from us on the best of days, in the best of places. And performing the best of actions. They are not just martyrs of Islam but they are martyrs of this nation, New Zealand.

Our loss of you is a gain to New Zealand’s unity and strength. Your departure is an awakening not just for our nation but for all humanity. Your martyrdom is a new life for New Zealand and a chance of prosperity for many. Our assembly here, with all the shades of our diversity, is a testament of our joint humanity. We are here in our hundreds and thousands unified for one purpose – that hate will be undone and love will redeem us.

We are taught by our prophet, Mohamed, that you can never truly show gratitude to the almighty God without thanking your fellow man.

To the people of New Zealand, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your tears. Thank you for your haka. Thank you for your flowers. Thank you for your love and compassion.

To our prime minister, thank you. Thank you for your leadership. It has been a lesson for the world’s leaders. Thank you for holding our families close and honouring us with a simple scarf. Thank you for your words and tears of compassion. Thank you for being one with us.

Thank you to the New Zealand government and to all the wonderful people who have shown us that we matter and are not forgotten.

Thank you to our police force and front-line services. You put our lives before your own every day.

Thank you to the neighbours who opened their doors to save us from the killer. Thank you to those who pulled over their cars to help us. Thank you to those who brought us food and helped us when we found it difficult to stand.

Thank you, thank you, New Zealand. Thank you for teaching the world what it means to love and care.

To my brothers and sisters, those who are here today, to perform the weekly Friday prayer, thank you for coming together once again. It is easy to feel lost after the trauma you and I experienced. But the promise of Allah made to us is true. Give glad news to the patient, those [who], when afflicted, say ‘to Allah we all belong, and to him we shall return’. These are those upon whom God’s mercy descends.

Thank you for your strength and your forgiveness. Thank you for your anger that is restrained and for your mercy that is overflowing. Thank you for your steadfastness and standing tall when others would fall. Thank you.

Islamophobia kills. Muslims have felt its pain before. It has killed people in Canada and it was used against us in Norway and against innocent people in the UK, USA, and other countries around the world.

Islamophobia is real. It is a targeted campaign to influence people to dehumanise and irrationally fear muslims. To fear what we wear, to fear the choice of food we eat, to fear the way we pray and to fear the way we practice our faith. We call upon governments around the world including New Zealand and the neighbouring countries to bring an end to hate speech and the politics of fear.

The martyrdom of 50 people and the injury of 42 did not come overnight, it was the result of the anti-Islamic and anti-Muslim rhetoric of some political leaders, media agencies and others.

Last week’s event is proof and evidence to the entire world that terrorism has no colour, has no race, and has no religion.

The rise of white supremacy and right-wing extremism is a great global threat to mankind and this must end now.

I want to take this opportunity to thank my Muslim and non-Muslim brothers and sisters for attending today and I would like also to thank our international guests who are with us and have come to our support and aid in these difficult times.

Oh Allah, have mercy upon us all. Oh Allah, have mercy upon those who were massacred last week. Oh Allah, grant to them the highest level of paradise. Oh Allah grant to the injured a speedy recovery and grant to the families of the victims patience. Oh Allah, grant our nation and country New Zealand peace, security, and protect it and its people from all evils. Oh Allah, grant to the entire world peace, security, and prosperity. Oh Allah, protect New Zealand, Oh Allah, protect New Zealanders and the world.

## 83, Biden praises Ardern for ‘galvanising action’ on gun control and climate change

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/biden-praises-ardern-for-galvanising-action-on-gun-control-and-climate-change

> US president welcomes New Zealand’s PM to Oval Office and speaks of devastation caused by mass shootings

New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has met US president Joe Biden to discuss shared concerns about China’s growing influence in the Pacific, as well as extremism and dealing with the aftermath of mass shootings.

The two leaders spoke for more than an hour, with Biden saying Ardern’s leadership on issues like climate change, violence and extremism was of international importance.

“Your leadership has taken on a critical role in this global stage,” Biden said. “It really has – galvanising action on climate change; the global effort to curb violence, extremism, and online, like happened in Christchurch.”

For New Zealand, the visit was a significant one – the first time a prime minister had visited the Oval Office since 2014. It comes at a time of heightened tensions in the Pacific region, where New Zealand is looking to shore up relationships amid a push by China to sign Pacific Island nations on to new security and economic pacts. But the two leaders’ different experiences with mass shootings, gun control and extremism also loomed large.

Ardern’s trip coincided with the aftermath of the Buffalo and Uvalde mass shootings. The prime minister’s own history on gun control – banning most-semi-automatic weapons in the wake of the Christchurch mosque shootings, which killed 51 in 2019 – made the issue an unexpected focus of her trip, especially for Americans frustrated by a lack of legislative action on gun control.

On mass shootings, Ardern said, “Our experience, of course, in this regard, is our own. But if there’s anything that we can share that would be of any value, we are here to share it.”

Biden spoke at some length about the grief that followed the shootings in New York and Texas, as he struggles to push a reluctant Congress to tighten gun laws. “There’s an expression by an Irish poet that says, ‘Too long a suffering makes a stone of the heart.’ Well, there’s an awful lot of suffering. I’ve been to more mass shooting aftermaths than, I think, any president in American history, unfortunately. … So much of it is preventable, and the devastation is amazing,” he said.

He spoke about his recent experience of spending hours speaking to Texas survivors and those who had lost loved ones, and said he wanted to speak with Ardern about her own conversations in the wake of the Christchurch attacks – including the Christchurch call, an international effort to curb online violent extremism.

“I want to work with you on that effort. And I want to talk to you about what those conversations were like, if you’re willing,” he said.

After the meeting, Ardern said: “While in New Zealand we know we have more work to do on the issue of gun crime, we can share what we have learned through the changes we made.”

For New Zealand, the highest priorities was discussing trade, climate, and the security of the Indo-Pacific region, where China has become an increasingly muscular player.

Biden emphasised that the US wanted to build relationships and “work together” in the region.

“I want to emphasise the last point you made: “working together”… We are not coming to dictate or lay down the law …. We have more work to do in those Pacific islands,” he said.

Ardern said following the meeting that the conversation “came at a critical moment” and the two leaders “recommitted to working together, and alongside others, in the pursuit of peace and stability, and in defence of the international rules-based order”.

Senior administration officials said the pair had spoken for significantly longer than expected – scheduled for an hour, the meeting ran to 90 minutes.

The pair also discussed the war in Ukraine, and trade partnerships, with Ardern urging Biden to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTTP).

## 84, The Guardian view on the Christchurch attacks: extremism’s rising danger

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-christchurch-attacks-extremisms-rising-danger

> The far right seeks to divide. Responsible politicians ought, especially in times of grief and anger, to bring people together

New Zealand is best known for its breathtaking wilderness, found in distant but secure islands at the edge of the world. On Friday that changed. Forty-nine people were killed in shootings at two mosques in central Christchurch in a suspected terrorist attack during the congregational prayer. The horrific events have left the country in mourning and shock. Muslims make up less than 1% of New Zealand’s population and the faith’s most prominent adherent is a rugby player. This was a stupefying amount of lethal force in a country that saw only 35 homicides in all of 2017. New Zealand as a nation will collectively have to deal with a trauma that no parent, no relative, no friend should ever endure.

At the time of writing, it is unclear whether Brenton Tarrant, the 28-year-old Australian suspected of both attacks, had accomplices. On a Facebook post last year he had called the people whom he had met while travelling in Pakistan, presumably all Muslim, “the most earnest, kind hearted and hospitable people in the world”. If Tarrant is the same man wearing military fatigues who livestreamed himself carrying out the attacks, then the humanity he had publicly recognised in others had in months been drained and replaced with hate. A Twitter account with the same name posted links to a manifesto reeking of white supremacist conspiracy theories.

The birth, growth and resilience of the far right, which once festered in dark nooks and crannies, has been assisted by the in-group echo chambers of social media. It now festers in plain sight. The manifesto, videos and photos associated with the latest atrocity have since been circulated on the web, where it is appalling to see some celebrating the attack. Too many media outlets in Britain thought nothing of dousing readers in this hateful bile. Responsible journalism must distinguish between its legitimate function to communicate information and the attempt by fascists to shut out perspectives, raise fears and heighten prejudice. The US news media, research shows, was hijacked from 2016 to 2018 to amplify the messages of hate groups. In Australia tabloids have portrayed attacks on South African farmers as evidence of “white genocide” while Sky News Australia apologised for interviewing a neo-Nazi.

Such atrocities and the trail of media posts left in their wake are designed to generate searches via racist memes and language. It is public relations by mass murder. The rise in hate speech, too readily accepted by some, is licensing violent acts. How else to explain such consistent increases? Similar dynamics lurk behind antisemitism’s reappearance. Last October the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history saw 11 people gunned down in a synagogue in Pittsburgh. This is why not only Muslims worldwide, but other minorities feel more vulnerable.

Politicians have created the swamp for such reptiles. White supremacists in America clearly believe that they have a fellow traveller in the White House. If they are mistaken then Donald Trump has hardly done much to disabuse them of this idea. Others have taken a cue from his overt race-baiting, unable even to resist the urge to whip up Islamophobia in the aftermath of the latest killings. Mr Trump could fill a bath with crocodile tears he has wept. In the US white supremacists and their ilk have killed far more people since 11 September 2001, than any other category of domestic extremist. The threat of violence from far-right extremists has been ignored for too long. In Britain the menace is recognised as so serious the security services have taken charge of it. During the Brexit referendum, a campaign swimming in reaction, a Labour MP was shot and stabbed by a neo-Nazi shouting “Britain first”. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has understood the threat the mosque attacks pose to her country’s society, imperilling the values New Zealanders cherish most – their solidarity, their sense of community and their feeling of safety. Many of the victims, she said, may be migrants or refugees and “they are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not”. Terrorists seek to divide. In grief and anger, communities must stand together.

## 85, US Republicans must follow Ardern’s lead and stand up to the gun lobby

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/19/us-republicans-follow-ardern-lead-stand-up-gun-lobby

> In stark contrast to the US, New Zealand is showing how a country invested in the safety of its citizens ought to respond

Hours after 50 worshippers were killed at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was already promising to tighten up the country’s gun laws. It’s a stark contrast to Donald Trump’s reaction to mass shootings, a written-by-numbers offer of “thoughts and prayers”, then a twiddle of his thumbs until the next atrocity. New Zealand’s response seems to have more in common with Scotland where the massacre at Dunblane primary school in 1996 led to a ban on all handguns.

There are some pronounced differences between the two countries. New Zealand’s gun laws are lax; the UK’s gun laws had already been tightened and semi-automatic centrefire rifles banned in the wake of the Hungerford massacre in 1987. But what Scotland and New Zealand share is little previous experience of spree shootings, a visceral shock at the scale of their country’s loss and a determination to prevent it happening again.

After it emerged that Thomas Hamilton had killed 16 young children and their teacher with legally owned handguns in Dunblane, there was huge public demand for action to be taken. With the country grieving, it wasn’t difficult for the Snowdrop campaign to drum up willing signatories to its petition calling for a handgun ban; by the time it was handed to parliament, more than 750,000 people had added their names. Dunblane’s political connections were also powerful. The town was in the constituency of the then secretary of state for Scotland, Michael Forsyth (who had a majority of only 703), and home to the shadow secretary of state for Scotland, George Robertson, who had previous dealings with Hamilton.

Despite all this, instituting a handgun ban was not straightforward; there were many in the gun lobby who opposed it with arguments not dissimilar to those made by America’s National Rifle Association (NRA). Some Tory backbenchers were reluctant to take this on and a decision was postponed until the Cullen inquiry report was published. In the meantime, however, the Labour party came up with a publicity coup: they invited Ann Pearston – the Conservative-voting co-founder of the Snowdrop campaign – to speak at their party conference. With delegates reduced to tears, the pressure was irresistible.

In the end, John Major’s government brought in the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997, which banned higher-calibre handguns. When Labour swept into power later that year, Tony Blair’s government extended the law to include .22 calibre handguns.

Ardern’s cabinet has said it will push for a ban on all semi-automatic weapons. But in a country with a strong hunting tradition, her government is likely to face similar opposition. Three previous attempts to tighten up the firearms laws – in 2005, 2012 and 2017 – failed due to the efforts of the gun lobby. There will also be logistical obstacles: for example, in the UK, legally owned handguns were registered so the police knew how many there were and where to find them. In New Zealand, once an individual has been granted a gun licence they can buy most types of guns without registering them, which means the police don’t know exactly how many are owned and by whom.

Despite these reservations, the signs so far are positive. On Monday, it emerged some gun owners had already handed in their weapons. Retail group Hunting & Fishing New Zealand also pulled “military-style” semi-automatic firearms from sale and the country’s largest auction website, Trade Me, announced it was removing all listings for semi-automatic guns and parts from its website. Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, whose NZ First party had previously opposed recommendations to restrict gun laws, intimated a willingness to compromise. “Our world changed forever and so will some of our laws,” he said.

It is almost impossible to imagine this happening in the US. After 20 children and six staff members were murdered at Sandy Hook in 2012, the then US president Barack Obama wept and promised a ban on assault weapons, but, blocked by Congress, he managed only a handful of smaller changes such as limiting magazine size. The US’s intractability is partly cultural: the right to bear arms is enshrined both in the US constitution and its psyche. It is partly logistical: with an estimated 101 guns for every 100 citizens, how could legislators begin to make an impact? But it is mostly financial: the NRA is such a potent organisation because it donates large sums of money to the Republican party.

In the past, the US has used New Zealand to demonstrate that lax gun laws do not necessarily lead to gun deaths. Though gun ownership in New Zealand is high (there are at least 1.5m legally owned weapons), the gun-related homicide rate is relatively low. Ipso facto, “guns don’t kill people, people kill people”, as the NRA would put it. Now that argument has evaporated and New Zealand post-Christchurch, like the UK post-Dunblane, is showing how a country invested in the safety of its citizens ought to respond.

Though the British ban on handguns did not stop another shooting spree taking place in Cumbria in 2010, it did result in a “slight, but significant” drop in gun crime and sent out a message about the kind of country we wanted to be: a country different from the US where the best solution the current president can come up with is to arm more civilians.

As for the tweets pledging “thoughts and prayers”, they’re an insult to the dead. If the Republican party really cared, it would follow the example set by the UK and (it seems likely) New Zealand; it would get off its knees and tell the NRA it is no longer in thrall to its millions of dollars.

## 86, Jacinda Ardern says leaders can be ‘sensitive and kind’ in farewell speech

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/jacinda-ardern-leaders-can-be-sensitive-kind-farewell-speech-new-zealand

> Former New Zealand PM calls for politics to be opened up for all in emotional address to parliament

Jacinda Ardern’s valedictory speech in full


“You can be anxious, sensitive, kind and wear your heart on your sleeve. You can be a mother, or not, an ex-Mormon, or not, a nerd, a crier, a hugger – you can be all of these things, and not only can you be here – you can lead.”

Jacinda Ardern has left New Zealand’s parliament with a highly personal, often emotional speech, calling for an opening up of politics to those who may not see themselves as typical leaders.

“I thought that I would need to change dramatically to survive. I didn’t,” Ardern said. “I leave this place as sensitive as I ever was – prone to dwell on the negative, hating [parliamentary] question time so deeply that I would struggle to eat most days beforehand.”

“I’m here to tell you, you can be that person and you can be here.”

In her final address to the country, Ardern opened up about her struggles as a prime minister, “a role I never thought I was meant to have”, talking about her worries, thin skin, and levels of anxiety that left her in cold sweats or unable to eat, as well as the political achievements and battles of her political career.

The valedictory address spanned the personal and the political, touching on her struggles with IVF and infertility and the impact of politics on her family, as well as the defining challenges of her leadership: the Covid-19 pandemic, the Christchurch mosque shootings, and the Whakaari volcanic eruption. She described her dramatic entry into politics as “a cross between a sense of duty to steer a moving freight train, and being hit by one”.

Wednesday afternoon was Ardern’s final day in parliament, and the speech marked her farewell to New Zealand parliamentary politics altogether. She nodded to the reasons that had driven her into political life, and the events that came to define her legacy.

“The reasons I came here … they’re all there in my maiden speech – climate change, child poverty, inequality. I am after all, a conviction-based politician,” she said. “Despite that, I have become used to my time as prime minister being distilled down into a different list: a domestic terror attack; a volcanic eruption; a pandemic; a series of events where I found myself in people’s lives during their most grief stricken or traumatic moments.”

Ardern became emotional as she spoke about meeting survivors in the immediate aftermath of the mosque terror attacks, and looked up to members of the Muslim community who sat in the public gallery, greeting them with “Assalamu alaikum”.

The ex-prime minister will leave a complex legacy: her achievements on the Covid response and responses to disasters and the Christchurch terror attacks on New Zealand’s Muslim community won her international recognition and acclaim, but slow progress on the housing crisis, inequality and the climate emergency tempered her achievements at home.

In Ardern’s maiden speech to parliament she had outlined her political commitments – primary among them the spectre of child poverty and New Zealand’s clean green reputation – and said that her words would come back to haunt her.

As Ardern leaves, those ghosts are still lingering. The government’s progress on child poverty since she took office has been significant, but limited – a few percentage points over the course of her prime ministership. On climate change, the process has been grindingly slow; this week, New Zealand announced its first quarterly drop in overall greenhouse gas emissions, after a series of successive increases.

One of the defining challenges of her leadership was the Covid-19 pandemic, and she spoke of New Zealand’s overall outcomes – including some of the lowest excess mortality rates in the world – as one of her most significant achievements. But she spoke, too, of the fractures that emerged in that period, the latter years of which were marked by anti-vaccine movements and protests. Ardern had been subject to a number of death threats in that time, and a near constant stream of violent, abusive rhetoric from extreme groups.

“We did lose other things along the way,” she said. “One, in some ways, was a sense of security, that we can engage in good robust debates and land on our respective positions relatively respectfully.”

She talked about being confronted by enraged protesters on the job, and her initial belief that she could talk them out of the more radical Covid conspiracy theories. “But after many of these same experiences, and seeing the rage that often sat behind these conspiracies, I had to accept I was wrong,” she said.

On Tuesday, Ardern had said she hoped her resignation could “lower the temperature” of New Zealand politics. That heat had been a regular feature of Ardern’s appearances in her final year in office – both the fever pitch of a violent occupation of parliament grounds in 2022, and in more piecemeal, often abusive protests that followed her to primary schools and speeches.

On the afternoon of her speech, however, no protesters were visible on parliament’s lawns.

She left to a standing ovation and loud singing, as MPs and the public rose to sing waiata – traditional Māori songs.

“Tutiro mai ngā iwi,” the crowds sang – roughly translated: “Line up together, people, all of us, seek after knowledge and love of others.”

## 88, Media are reluctant to label far-right attackers as terrorists, study says

https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/10/media-are-reluctant-label-far-right-attackers-terrorists-study-says

> Global research finds violent Islamists are three times more likely to be called terrorists 

Violent Islamist extremists are three times more likely than far-right attackers to be described as terrorists in the media, according to an overview of more than 200,000 news articles and broadcast transcripts.

The research found Islamist attacks were linked to terrorism in 78% of news reports about the incidents, whereas those from the far right who carried out violent attacks were only identified as terrorists 24% of the time.

The study was carried out by Signal AI, which has built a database of news output to help firms monitor how they are covered in the media. The company analysed news reports about 11 different terror attacks that took place in the last two years, plus transcripts of TV and radio broadcasts in 80 different languages, to identify a consistent reluctance by media outlets to describe far-right attackers as terrorists.

“Reporting on Islamic extremist attacks is quantifiably different to reporting on far-right attacks,” the company concluded, amid warnings from British authorities about the growing threat of far-right terrorists.

They found the media was unusually willing to label the far-right attacker who targeted two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, last month as a terrorist. Signal suggested this could be due to the decision by the country’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, to brand the incident an act of terror within six hours of the incident, which caused media outlets to swiftly follow her lead.

By comparison, other world leaders such as Donald Trump have been more reluctant to brand some comparable incidents – such as the October 2018 attack on a Pittsburg synagogue – as acts of terror, which in turn resulted in the media being reluctant to apply the term. Labelling individuals as terrorists has always been a controversial decision, with politicians often inconsistent in how they distinguish between a generic attack and an ideology-motivated act of terror.

“The Christchurch shooting is actually exceptional in how willing the media were to label the shooter a terrorist,” concluded Signal, suggesting media reports tend to follow decisions made by political leaders. “The reasons for this are not entirely clear but seems to have been added to by Ardern’s bold and immediate stance on the attack. If this is the case, it shows that influential figures may have the ability to shift the narrative around events and topics. Spokespeople’s language filters into the media and, likely, into public dialogue.”

Signal’s methodology involved comparing the number of news reports which mention an attacker alongside the words “terrorism”, “terrorist”, “terror” or “suicide bomber”, compared with the number of reports that name an attack but fail to mention any of those terms.

Signal found that TV and radio outlets were less likely than websites and newspapers to brand incidents of any variety as acts of terror, possibly due to the comparatively short length of broadcast news bulletins. The Guardian’s parent company has a small stake in the company through its GMG Ventures investment arm.

The data could be skewed by the widespread use of news agencies, which means many news outlets run near-identical stories based on the same original reporting, amplifying a handful of early editorial decisions made shortly after an attack. In addition, the media monitoring database used by Signal is only 15 months old, meaning it is relying on retrospective reporting when considering how the media describes incidents that occurred in 2017, such as the Manchester Arena bombing by an Islamist extremist and the far-right attack on a Quebec mosque.

However, Ben Moore, the Signal analyst who carried out the study, said no matter how the issue was analysed and which set of news sources were used, the overall pattern remained that Islamist attacks are substantially more likely to be branded as acts of terror than attacks by supporters of far-right causes.

“The trend was so consistent,” he said.

## 90, Jacinda Ardern’s grief should not eclipse that of Muslims

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/02/jacinda-ardern-christchurch-grief-muslims-new-zealand

> The New Zealand prime minister’s response to the Christchurch killings is to be admired, but the focus must be on the Muslim communities affected

Since the Christchurch terror attack, much of the focus has been not on the mourning of New Zealand’s Muslim community, but on white people. This has been repeated across the west, and in parts of the Middle East. Jacinda Ardern’s face was projected on to the outside of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai days after the attack.

The prime minister’s response to the shooting has indeed been exemplary but the reaction to it has left little space for the victims, or the wider Muslim community in New Zealand or around the world. While many of us are still coming to terms with the events that happened in Christchurch, I have seen more pictures of Ardern’s grief and mourning than of the Muslim community in New Zealand, the victims or those who acted bravely on the day to save lives and fight against the terrorist.

To give an example, as I opened the pages of a prominent London magazine, I saw the face of Ardern, eyes closed, hugging a hijab-wearing Muslim woman whose back was to the camera. I thought about the positioning, about whose grief we were seeing. I thought about why our grief seemingly wasn’t palatable. Was that the reason the media had decided to use a white woman – someone more familiar, someone who isn’t an “other” – to sell their papers and fuel online clicks? In this Islamophobic world, is it the case that even Muslim grief doesn’t sell and it needs to come repackaged with a graceful and mourning white face donning a dupatta?

Yet when I’ve voiced these reservations over the past weeks, I’ve been told I’m a disgrace to Muslims for not accepting the more than adequate solidarity we’ve received. I’ve been told to fuck off by a white man and seen the same white man tell another Muslim woman he was off to join Ukip because she disagreed with him. I’ve been condemned for voicing discomfort at the lionisation of Ardern doing her job properly.

I’ve also been criticised for telling white women that a gesture such as wearing a hijab for a single day might be problematic, because it centres on themselves and in many cases co-opts the only part of someone’s identity they are familiar with.

Performative solidarity isn’t enough. People died and no amount of empathy is going to bring them back. Those standing in solidarity need to understand that they should use their everyday privilege to truly tackle Islamophobia in the long term, in its myriad daily manifestations. Just rocking up for one day and then forgetting about the Islamophobic world we exist in is not good enough. The kind of solidarity being shown in the west risks becoming a self-regarding state of “wokeness”. It’s the same problem when white people create a diversity panel and invite some diverse people. And then at the end of the panel those same white people go home and feel much better about themselves because of what they did, but the diverse participants who have tried to justify and explain their existence for an hour go home as well, knowing they are still “diverse” and will have to go on living with that day to day. This is gestural stuff.

I trust very much that Ardern is unbothered about the online world demanding she receive the Nobel peace prize – she is getting on with her job. But the framing of Muslim pain through the words and actions of Ardern has been so overwhelming and disturbing that I’m unwilling to sit quietly and let it pass. Because I’m worried that next time there is a massacre of a Muslim community, for anyone to care it will take another Ardern to lead the mourning. More than 130 Muslims were killed in Mali just over a week ago. Where is the coverage? Internment camps in China continue to hold Uighur Muslims; the war in Yemen shows no sign of ending; the Rohingya crisis had its five minutes of fame in the media and isn’t making headlines any more.

In a speech Ardern gave in parliament days after the Christchurch attack she said: “Speak the names of those who were lost, rather than the name of the man who took them.” Ardern is playing her role, but I implore you, let’s name and tell the stories of those who were massacred: Abdukadir Elmi, Abdul Fattah Qasem, Abdus Samad, Ahmed Abdel Ghani, Ali Elmadani, Amjad Hamid, Ansi Alibava, Ashraf Ali, Ashraf Al-Masri, Ashraf Morsi, Asif Vora, Atta Elayyan, Daoud Nabi, Farhaj Ahsan, Ghulam Husain, Hafiz Musa Vali Patel, Hamza Mustafa, Haroon Mehmood, Hosne Ahmed, Hussain al-Umari, Hussein Moustafa, Junaid Kara/Ismail, Kamel Mohamad Kamel Darweesh, Karam Bibi, Khaled Mustafa, Lilik Abdul Hamid, Linda Armstrong, Maheboob Khokhar, Matiullah Safi, Mohamad Moosi Mohamedhosen, Mohammed Imran Khan, Mohsen Mohammed Al Harbi, Mojammel Hoq, Mounir Suleiman, Mucad Ibrahim, Muhammad Haziq bin Mohd Tarmizi, Musa Nur Awale, Naeem Rashid, Omar Faruk, Osama Adnan Abu Kweik, Ozair Kadir, Ramiz Vora, Sayyad Milne, Sohail Shahid, Syed Areeb Ahmed, Syed Jahandad Ali, Talha Rashid, Tariq Omar, Zakaria Bhuiya, Zeeshan Raza.

Let’s concentrate on those left behind and let’s loudly applaud those who intervened; such as Abdul Aziz Wahabzadah who chased away the terrorist by throwing a cash register at him. Let’s redirect the focus of this tragedy. Ardern doesn’t need the attention but Muslims across the globe need more than performative solidarity.

## 91, Christchurch shooter was active with Australian far-right groups online but escaped police attention

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/08/christchurch-shooter-was-active-with-australian-far-right-groups-online-but-escaped-police-attention

> Inquiry details how gunman expressed support for Australian extremist in Facebook posts and engaged with neo-Nazi groups’ social media 

The Australian shooter who killed 51 Muslim worshipers at a mosque in Christchurch last year was active in far-right groups in his home country but escaped the attention of authorities, despite allegedly being reported to Australian police for sending threatening messages.

The Christchurch royal commission report into the 2019 massacre released on Tuesday shines further light on Brenton Tarrant’s long involvement with the far-right in Australia.

It detailed how between April 2016 and early 2017 Tarrant regularly expressed support and admiration for Blair Cottrell, then the leader of the now-defunct far-right group United Patriots Front. Cottrell is an Australian far-right extremist with a string of criminal convictions who in 2018 appeared as a guest in an uncritical interview on Sky News.

The commission found that two years before the Christchurch massacre, the shooter posted “approximately 30 comments” on the UPF’s Facebook page, expressing his support and admiration for Cottrell in several of them.

In 2016, when Donald Trump was elected US president, the shooter wrote on the group’s Facebook page that “globalists and Marxists on suicide watch, patriots and nationalists triumphant – looking forward to Emperor Blair Cottrell coming soon”.

The ABC has previously revealed details of some of those comments, but the report also showed the shooter expressed support for Cottrell in other groups, including on the Facebook page of another far-right group in Australia, the True Blue Crew.

Cottrell has previously said he never met Tarrant and recently described him as “an idiot”.

The shooter moved to the New Zealand town of Dunedin in August 2017 after a long period spent travelling the globe using money inherited from his father following his death.

The commission’s report also details his involvement with the Lads Society, another far-right neo-Nazi group founded in 2017 by one of Cottrell’s deputies in the UPF, New-Zealand born Tom Sewell.

Guardian Australia has previously revealed Sewell’s ambitions to attract members from mainstream society to the Lads Society under the guise of a men’s fitness club, while secretly harbouring an explicitly white supremacist agenda.

Following the shooting in Christchurch, Sewell told the Sydney Morning Herald he had previously approached the shooter to join the Lads Society but that he had turned him down.

But the commission’s report reveals the shooter was “an active member” of two Facebook pages run by the Lads Society. Using a pseudonym, the shooter made a number of posts in its private groups between September 2017 and April 2018.

“He was an active contributor, posting on topics related to issues occurring in Europe, New Zealand and his own life, far right memes, media articles, YouTube links (many of which have since been removed for breaching YouTube’s content agreements) and posts about people who were either for or against his views,” the commission’s report states.

According to the report, in early February 2018 the shooter was “engaged in online discussion with members of the Lads Society”, including making veiled threats about an Islamic school near where he lived in New Zealand.

“Having identified the apparent problem of Muslim immigration rates, but offering no democratic solution, we consider the post by the individual was an implied call to violence and, in this way, another illustration of his ethno-nationalist beliefs,” the commission’s report stated.

The report also reveals the shooter was “allegedly” brought to the attention of Australian police after he sent threatening messages to “an Australian critic of the United Patriots Front”.

In August 2016, the shooter sent messages to the person via Facebook Messenger saying “I hope one day you meet the rope”, a reference to a far-right trope used to refer to a race war.

The report said the person who received the messages “allegedly reported [them] to Australian police”. But “no action was taken”, it said.

Although Tarrant had previously expressed concern to family members that he was being tracked by Australian security agencies, the report seems to suggest he was not on their radar.

It stated the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation told the royal commission that prior to the massacre in 2019 the shooter “had not been identified” by it, “nor was he the subject of an … investigation”.

While the UPF is long-defunct, Cottrell and Sewell remain prominent in Australia’s extreme-right ecosystem. Sewell, in particular, remains central to the movement. Last month he wrote to his almost 900 subscribers on Telegram that following the shooting he had decided the Lads Society model “was not strong or explicit enough”.

“Splits and desertion began occurring as police began a process of harassment against our organisation,” he wrote.

“I decided that the Lads Society mode had some great ideas to it, but it was not strong enough or explicit enough … it tried to create a ‘broad tent’ approach instead of forming a strong cadre of men who would create the stem cell of our future leadership of White Australians”.

Last month he also posted a 10-minute video which ended with him shouting “blood and honour” before making the Nazi salute.

The royal commission’s findings has prompted Labor’s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, to call on the government to establish a parliamentary inquiry examining the threat of rightwing extremism in Australia.

She said the parliament should investigate whether “our proscription laws to list groups as terrorist organisations are fit for purpose and whether our counter-terrorism programs and our preventing of radicalisation will work when it comes to rightwing extremism”.

“Understandably in Australia we have been focused in the last 20 years on the threat that comes from Islamic extremism, Islamic jihadism, but rightwing extremism is different,” she said on Tuesday.

“They have different motivations, different organisational structures, different methods and tactics. And when our AFP and our Asio experts tell us that they are spending increasing amounts of time and they’re increasingly concerned about the threat posed by rightwing extremism, the parliament should act.”

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/17/ask-the-prime-minister-send-us-your-questions-for-jacinda-ardern

> As Aotearoa New Zealand heads for an election in 2020, what would you like to ask the PM about? Climate change? Gun buybacks? Housing? Over to you ...

We are expanding our coverage of New Zealand. Please help us by supporting our independent journalism


With New Zealand’s election less than a year away Jacinda Ardern may be hugely personally popular, and her party polling well, but she will face plenty of challenges to stay in the top job.

Not least of those will be the threat from smaller parties, which could claim crucial votes under New Zealand’s proportional representation voting system and potentially unseat her.

The ongoing Ihumātao dispute has hit the headlines this year and some see the stand-off as part of a global movement to assert Indigenous rights. Her refusal to visit the site was widely reported.

But she has plenty of other events on her re-election CV.

The recently passed zero-carbon bill drew global attention. The landmark legislation, which was passed with with cross-party support, committed the country to reducing its emissions to zero by 2050.

Ardern said it showed New Zealand was on the “right side of history”, although her message that farmers must cut emissions or face penalties as early as 2022 did not play well in all quarters.

The massacre in Christchurch in March has no doubt been one of the defining events of her premiership, including her refusal to name the man accused of the attacks. The gun buyback that followed saw sweeping reforms to remove military-style semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles.

When we recently asked New Zealand’s Guardian readers what they thought the country needed to do to prepare for a population of 5 million people – a milestone expected next year – you told us that improving infrastructure, slowing immigration and putting more emphasis on the regions were priorities.

So now it’s your turn to ask the PM questions directly, by filling out the form below. We asked the leader of the opposition, Simon Bridges, to take part too, but he declined.

## 93, Bohemian Rhapsody and a BBQ: Stephen Colbert visits Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/stephen-colbert-jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-late-show-bbq-bohemiam-rhapsody

> Prime minister collects chat show host from the airport in first episode of ‘The Newest Zealander’

The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert engaged in potentially copyright-infringing carpool karaoke with prime minister Jacinda Ardern and pranked Lorde at a barbecue – aka a “New Zealand state dinner” – as he made good on a promise to get as far away as possible from news about Donald Trump.

The chat show host got straight to it in his sit-down interview with the New Zealand prime minister for Tuesday night’s opening episode, called the “Newest Zealander”, pleading to become a citizen and offering to marry Ardern and partner Clarke Gayford.

Ardern seemed keen, Gayford less so (“Um, I mean, sure ... let’s talk”).

The US chatshow host also gave Ardern, of whom he said he was a “huge admirer”, a suggested 2020 election campaign slogan: “New Zealand, same prime minister”.

Colbert’s week-long visit to New Zealand began with the host being suitably impressed that Ardern picked him up at the airport. Ardern explained how she managed to fit it into her schedule: “I am a woman, I multi-task.”

Colbert bagged the most memorable moment of the episode: a duet of Bohemian Rhapsody. He earlier warned: “That is James Corden’s thing and that guy is mobbed up with lawyers. He will come after us with a sharp stick.”

Then it was on to a good, old-fashioned Kiwi barbecue with usual ingredients: sausages, buttered white bread, a garden salad, and New Zealand pop star Lorde.

There was a sombre moment, too, when Colbert and Ardern discussed New Zealand’s gun law reforms that followed the Christchurch mosque shootings in March. “I just went out there and said: ‘Our laws will change’.”

It’s a far cry from the cringeworthy appearance by former prime minister John Key on the Late Show with David Letterman Show in 2009, where a clearly nervous Key fumbled his way through a “top 10 reasons to visit New Zealand” list.

Key’s appearance at the time cost taxpayers $10,000 and while Colbert’s trip has cost 10 times as much, it has been largely viewed as far better value for money. The talk show host, who has a television audience of 3.5 million, is an enthusiastic and vocal fan of New Zealand, and Tourism New Zealand has said it was expecting a “significant return on investment” of $5m in estimated advertising value from Colbert’s trip.

Colbert’s Kiwiana experience will also feature other bucket-list items in future episodes, including Sir Peter Jackson and Hobbiton, rugby lessons and tour of Wellington with Xena: Warrior Princess star Lucy Lawless and Bret McKenzie of Flight of the Conchords fame.

## 94, New Zealand begins first round of gun buybacks after Christchurch attack

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/13/new-zealand-begins-first-round-of-gun-buybacks-after-christchurch-attack

> Government has set aside more than NZ$200m to remove military-style firearms from circulation

Dozens of Christchurch gun owners have handed over their weapons in exchange for cash in the first of more than 250 planned buyback events around New Zealand after the government outlawed many types of semi-automatics.

Police said they paid more than $NZ200,000 in total to 68 gun owners in the first few hours of the event held on Saturday.

In April, New Zealand lawmakers rushed through new legislation to ban military-style weapons after 51 people were killed at two Christchurch mosques on 15 March.

Brenton Tarrant, an Australian, is facing 51 charges of murder, 40 of attempted murder and one of engaging in a terrorist act in relation to the Christchurch shootings, and has pleaded not guilty to all charges. The trial, estimated to take six weeks, will go ahead on 4 May 2020.

A bill outlawing most automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and components that modify existing weapons, was passed by a vote of 119 to 1 in April in the House of Representatives after an accelerated process of debate and public submission.

The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, had spoken emotionally during the bill’s final reading, telling of the traumatic injuries to the victims of the March attacks, whom she had visited in hospital.

“I struggle to recall any single gunshot wounds,” Ardern said. “In every case they spoke of multiple injuries, multiple debilitating injuries that deemed it impossible for them to recover in days, let alone weeks. They will carry disabilities for a lifetime, and that’s before you consider the psychological impact. We are here for them.

“I could not fathom how weapons that could cause such destruction and large-scale death could be obtained legally in this country.”

The government has set aside more than NZ$200m to buy back weapons such as AR-15 style rifles, although many gun owners remain unhappy with the compensation on offer.

Under an amnesty, gun owners have until December to turn over their now-banned weapons.

The total number of firearms in New Zealand is estimated to be between 1.2m and 1.5m.

Jacinda Ardern has distanced herself from a recently released biography documenting her leadership style, less than a week after joining widespread criticism of a film that focuses on her role leading New Zealand during the Christchurch terror attacks.

The new book – Jacinda Ardern: Leading with Empathy – was written by activist and journalist Supriya Vani, and writer Carl A. Harte, based on “Vani’s exclusive interviews with Ardern”, according to its seller, Simon & Schuster.

But at a press conference on Monday, the prime minister said that she was “clearly” misled by Vani about the intent of the interview and premise of the book. Ardern said she was approached in 2019 and “told the author was writing a book on women and political leadership”.

“I was told there were roughly 10 other female political leaders involved,” she said. Ardern said she agreed to the interview only “on that basis, given it was not specific to me”.

She said that “the claim that it was an exclusive interview for the purpose of writing a book of that nature [a biography] is not true”, and said she would ask that the claim be clarified.

Harte denied the claim she was misled, saying Ardern’s office was later made aware the book’s framing had changed to become a biography.

The spat comes at a moment when presentations of Ardern in international media – often glowing - are under particular scrutiny in New Zealand. A proposed film about the Christchurch mosque attacks, called They Are Us and starring Rose Byrne as Ardern, has been fiercely criticised over accusations that Muslim victims have been sidelined in favour of a focus on Ardern.

Ardern said on Sunday she was not an appropriate focus for a film about the 2019 mosque attacks. “There are plenty of stories from March 15 that could be told, but I don’t consider mine to be one of them,” she said. Ardern reiterated that she has no involvement with the film.

In a statement to the Guardian, Harte confirmed the original interview was for a book profiling a number of female leaders. “Prime Minister Ardern was, however, not misled, because at the time of the interview, we had no intention of writing a biography on her alone,” he said.

Harte said they shifted tack to a biography of Ardern after Covid-19 precluded plans for interviews with other world leaders, and because “her story deserved a book in itself, for her model leadership”.

“Our decision to change direction – something that, I must say, is the hallmark of many creative endeavours – was made in 2020.”

He said Ardern’s office was aware the book’s framing had changed to biography, saying that in January, Vani had “informed the prime minister’s office of our intention to publish our biography of Jacinda Ardern, and shared the cover”.

“We regret the misunderstanding,” Harte added. “We stand by our book”.

Vani did not provide independent comment, but said she would refer the request to her co-author.

The book’s claims of exclusive interviews with the prime minister raised some eyebrows in New Zealand, because Ardern does not typically grant interviews to biographers. Two senior New Zealand journalists, Madeleine Chapman and Michelle Duff, have written biographies of Ardern. Neither were able to secure an interview.

A brief excerpt from Vani’s interview was published by Vani in a Writers Digest article about how to write and research a biography. Vani asks: “I feel that you laid the foundation of your personality when you instantly empathised in your own childhood with the children on the streets of New Zealand without shoes on their feet or anything to eat. Would you agree with me that you could observe all these things because you were born an empathetic person”? Ardern responds, “I would like to believe that it is something that is an inherent trait for all of us. It’s about having the space to be empathetic.”

Simon & Schuster quote Booklist as having called the book a “readable, admiring biography”. In a review for the Spinoff, Toby Manhire calls it “utterly uncritical, fawning, cloying”.

A passage describing Ardern’s outfits on her visit to Europe reads: “In London, she upped the ante, featuring perhaps the most graceful, regal attire ever worn by a New Zealand prime minister at an international event.”

It goes on: “The effect was breathtaking … Even the Queen looked impressed.”

Another compares her favourably to the great British wartime leader Winston Churchill because of her response to the pandemic. “If there is a Winston Churchill of the war against Covid-19, for her success in rallying her country to fight the virus, there’s a good argument to say it’s Jacinda Ardern.”

The book is sold by Simon & Schuster and appears to have multiple publishers across different jurisdictions, including Harper Collins India, Hardie Grant in Australia and New Zealand, and Oneworld Publications. The Guardian has approached Simon & Schuster, Oneworld Publications, Hardie Grant and Harper Collins India for comment.

## 97, The Observer view on Jacinda Ardern setting a global standard in leadership

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/31/observer-view-on-jacinda-ardern-setting-global-standard-in-leadership

> In commemorating the Christchurch victims, New Zealand’s prime minister confronted hatred and division

Two prime ministers, on opposite sides of the world, delivered sharply contrasting performances last week. In New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern found the strength and understanding to give voice to a wounded nation’s horror and grief. Her address at a remembrance service in Christchurch for victims of the 15 March mosque attacks rose far above the merely dutiful. It was inspiring, consoling and defiant in equal measure.

Unexpectedly faced by an appalling atrocity, Ardern has shown exemplary leadership skills. Her instinct was to trust her humanity and the humanity of others. By quickly moving to meet, embrace and comfort the bereaved, by wearing the hijab, by taking swift action on gun control and by refusing to acknowledge the killer, she brought out the best in her fellow citizens.

What could have become an ugly slugfest of recrimination and blame, fuelling hatred as the attacker hoped, became instead a moment when a nation came together, honoured its differences, accepted its failings and united behind a future vision of a land where bigotry and racism are not welcome. “The answer lies in our humanity,” Ardern said. “We each hold the power – in our words, in our actions, in our daily acts of kindness. Let that be the legacy of the 15th of March.”

Ardern did not pretend to have all the answers. As in other countries, ignorance, prejudice and intolerance, fomenting social division and political extremism cannot be wholly eliminated. But in confronting these evils in so compelling, uncompromising a manner, New Zealand’s prime minister set a global standard that national leaders everywhere should follow. At present, too many do the opposite, purposefully exploiting fear of the other for narrow political ends – or simply because they, too, are ignorant and prejudiced.

Beneficent leadership skills can be instinctive – or they can be learned. Research conducted by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner, co-authors of the 1987 bestseller, The Leadership Challenge, identifies five core practices. At their best, they say, good leaders “model the way” (establish principles and goals); “inspire a shared vision” (open minds to new possibilities); “challenge the process” (find innovative, imaginative ways to change the status quo); “enable others to act” (empowerment); and “encourage the heart” (maintain hope and belief).

Look around the world and it is hard to find leaders who tick all five boxes, though there are occasional flashes. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, has done well recently in persuading disaffected voters there is a shared vision for their country. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, shook things up last week by demanding Spain and the pope apologise for colonial era depredations.

In unheroic Brussels, Donald Tusk, president of the European council, continued his stand against Brexit. Having reserved “a special place in hell” for those in Britain who tell Brexit whoppers, Tusk engaged in a classic empowerment exercise last week, assuring Remain petitioners they would not be forgotten.

All of which brings us back to that other prime minister whose performance last week shattered any remaining illusions about her fitness to lead. Three consecutive parliamentary defeats, the latest on Friday, for her signature EU withdrawal deal say all that is needed about Theresa May’s political authority. Yet these humiliations point to a more fundamental problem of leadership.

From the start of the Brexit process, May failed to establish agreed goals and principles. She could not share a vision of Britain’s future because she lacked one herself. Rather than empower others to take part, she excluded them at every turn and, once committed, was unable to imagine alternatives. Far from inspiring, her cold and lofty personal style disheartened and dismayed. May tried to dictate, not lead, with eyes and ears firmly closed – and has deservedly found only oblivion.

## 98, New Zealand gun buyback: 10,000 firearms returned after Christchurch attack

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/new-zealand-gun-buyback-10000-firearms-returned-after-christchurch-attack

> Police praise response after thousands of now-banned guns taken out of circulation in less than a month

More than 10,000 firearms have been bought by New Zealand’s government in less than a month as part of its gun buyback scheme following the Christchurch mosque shootings in March.

Following the killing of 51 people in two inner-city Christchurch mosques by an Australian white supremacist, prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s government rushed through legislation to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons and set aside NZ$150m to buy firearms that were now illegal.

A bill outlawing most automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and components that modify existing weapons, was passed by a vote of 119 to 1 in April.

“I could not fathom how weapons that could cause such destruction and large-scale death could be obtained legally in this country,” Ardern said at the time. “I struggle to recall any single gunshot wounds. In every case they [victims] spoke of multiple injuries, multiple debilitating injuries that deemed it impossible for them to recover in days, let alone weeks. They will carry disabilities for a lifetime, and that’s before you consider the psychological impact. We are here for them.”

The shooter bought the weapons for the killings legally in New Zealand, despite experts initially suspecting they had been acquired on the blackmarket.

The governments gun-buyback scheme was launched in mid July. Since then, 10,242 firearms have been handed into police, with an additional 1,269 firearms handed in under amnesty.

The amnesty mean no questions will be asked by police about when or how owners acquired the now-banned weapons, even if they don’t have a current firearms licence or paperwork for the weapons.

Ninety gun collection events have been held around the country, New Zealand police said, attended by more than 7,000 firearms owners. In a statement New Zealand police praised gun owners’ engagement with the process, and said they were “really happy” with the public response.

In the days and weeks following the worst massacre in New Zealand’s modern history some firearms owners voluntarily handed in their weapons, citing disgust at the carnage they had caused on 15 March.

However, others began stockpiling weapons and ammunition that would soon be banned, and numerous gun clubs and hunting associations have criticised the buyback scheme, saying the compensation offered was paltry and the majority of law-abiding gun owners should not be penalised for the actions of one individual.

Unlike the US where the right to self-protection if often quoted, the majority of New Zealand gun owners say they own weapons for sport, recreation and hunting.

The total number of firearms in New Zealand is estimated to be between 1.2m and 1.5m, and gun owners of now-prohibited weapons have until 20 December to hand in their weapons.

Possession of a banned weapon or part can carry a prison term of two to five years.

## 99, After Christchurch, New Zealand's Muslim women shouldn't have to rebuild on their own

https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/dec/11/new-zealands-christchurch-muslim-women-should-not-have-to-bear-the-burden-of-rebuilding-after-christchurch-on-their-own

> The report into the mosque attacks basically told those affected to fend for themselves – the government must support us

In New Zealand, strong women leaders are regularly referred to as wāhine toa. This is not a term used lightly, but rather a title given to women who show exceptional leadership and continue to support those around them even in the face of enormous difficulties. Some might refer to New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, as a wāhine toa, but it can be also used for women within general society who display consistent courage and strength.

In the 15 March 2019 Christchurch terrorist attack, 51 people (47 men and four women) died in two mosques. As fate would have it, the majority of those who were lost were male … and the majority of those left to shoulder the impact, to pick up the pieces and to take charge were female – wives, mothers, daughters, sisters. Leading a family is a challenge on a regular day, but under such circumstances, after such a violent, destructive act, it has unsurprisingly been daunting.

There can be no doubt that the last 20 months have been challenging for New Zealand, for our Muslim community and for these women. Trying to rebuild one’s life is never easy, but to do so while so many others are also suffering has been an enormous test. Yet, these women are doing exactly that. Like birds whose nests have been knocked down, they were distressed, but slowly and surely, they set out to rebuild themselves and those around them. They are each wāhine toa.

Immediately after the attack, New Zealand set up a royal commission of inquiry to look into whether that terrorism could have been prevented and to determine what should be done so that another such event does not occur. Our community, and within it the women, had hoped the commission would put things right by providing answers as well about also offering restorative justice options for the families. Unfortunately, the commission’s report did neither.

On its release this week, it became immediately apparent that the commission’s work had been hindered not only by the restrictive terms of reference, but also by the fact the Muslim community had not been allowed to see, hear or challenge relevant information. As no public hearings had been held, conflicting testimony was unresolved and significant matters left unattended.

While the commissioners found major problems and concerns with the government’s efforts prior to the attack and made 44 solid recommendations that will require an overhaul of ministries and several agencies, the report surprisingly did not conclude the attack was preventable and did not apportion blame.

Of the nearly 800 pages of findings and recommendations, the commission focused on rebuilding the systems and did not offer the government substantive ideas on how to restore our people. In less than three pages of the report, the impacted were told they would have to approach the government themselves. Basically, our families were left to fend for themselves.

At the report’s public release, the heads of the New Zealand police, our Security Intelligence Service and the prime minister apologised on behalf of the government and indicated all recommendations would be adopted. But like the commission, they have thus far avoided discussing what efforts they intend to take to ensure the impacted are restored as best possible to where they were prior to the attack.

By sheer coincidence and Covid-related date changes, the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand, the national umbrella organisation for Muslim women, will meet this weekend at its 30th annual conference in Christchurch. Muslim women from around the New Zealand will come together for sisterhood, rejuvenation and spirituality, but also to discuss the matters that are impacting their lives. The commission’s report will be an item discussed as will the whereto from here. We will continue to advocate and to seek solutions to strengthen and uplift our women.

While these women, each a wāhine toa, have shown amazing resilience, like flowers that bloom on charred soil after a fire, they should not have to shoulder this burden on their own. The council will work to support them. We ask that the New Zealand government do the same.

Aliya Danzeisen has led the government engagement for the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand for seven years and has played a key advocacy role in getting support for the Kiwi Muslim community.

> Thousands gather in Christchurch for Friday prayers outside Hagley mosque as imam says those who died were ‘the best of us’

‘Broken-hearted but not broken’: imam’s speech in full
We shall speak their names: those who died in the mosque shootings


We’re going to wrap up the blog for the day. Thank you for reading.

Our full story is here.

There are three major community-led vigils happening around New Zealand this weekend.

Auckland, 6pm Friday

The first of the three is at the Auckland Domain tonight, from 6 to 8pm. People are asked to gather in front of the grandstand at the southwestern end. Police said they are expecting thousands to attend and have closed a number of roads around the Domain.Christchurch, 10am Saturday 

The same school students who organised the School Strike for Climate march which was shut down by reports of an active shooter last Friday have organised a March for Love this Saturday. Thousands are expected to gather in North Hagley Park at 10am for speeches followed by the march.

Christchurch, 5pm Sunday

A vigil called “remember those who lost their lives” will be held from 5-7pm in Hagley Park on Sunday. Again, thousands are expected to attend and people are advised to take public transport.

There are more than 1,000 mourners gathered at Christchurch’s memorial park cemetery for the burial of 26 victims of the mosque attacks this afternoon, among them the youngest victim of the attack, three-year-old Mucaad Ibrahim.

Dozens of media agencies, most of which are international, have been allowed to film from the edge of the cemetery.

It is crowded, and the MC is trying to organise a large crowd to endure bodies can be carried safely and close family has an opportunity to say goodbye. There are volunteers in high visibility vests to help keep order. Armed police are guarding entrances to the cemetery, and mourners keep walking in and out. Every few minutes, the sound of prayer indicates a body being carried for burial.

The mass burial of being held to ensure that all can be buried in accordance with Islamic tradition, which dictates that a person be buried as soon as possible after death.

The majority of the bodies were only released back to their families from the coroner yesterday. The seven days it has taken for burial is already far too long; no one is prepared to wait longer.

Today’s funerals are the last in Christchurch relating to the attack. Other victims are being buried in other cities or in their home countries.

Our team have built this beautiful interactive that shows the names and brief stories of those who have been confirmed dead in last week’s attacks.

Women around New Zealand have donned head scarves today in solidarity with Muslim women.

Under the hashtags #headscarfforharmony and #ScarvesInSolidarity, women have been sharing photographs of themselves wearing the scarves.

The event is supported by the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand and the NZ Muslim Association.

Moving video of school students in Christchurch performing the haka at a memorial for 50 people killed in Friday’s massacre has its roots in another recent tragedy.

The Tahu Pōtiki haka is specific to Te Waipounamu, New Zealand’s South Island. It has an ancient history but became widely used in Christchurchfollowing the 2011 earthquakes as a way to help the community, and particularly school students, cope with a disaster that killed 185 people.

Now it is being used to show respect for those affected by another traumatic event.

The first line, “Otautahi, Maraka Maraka,” is a rallying call for Christchurch to rise up and remain resolute.

Full story here.

An Australian national security official says security agencies are increasing their “scrutiny and pressure” on white supremacists after the New Zealand mosque attack.

Home Affairs Department chief executive Mike Pezzullo told a Senate committee on Friday that Australian agencies were working to assist the New Zealand investigation into the Australian man arrested in the killings of 50 worshippers in two Christchurch mosques last week.

Pezzullo said the Home Affairs Department stood resolutely against white supremacy and he addressed its adherents, saying: “The scrutiny and pressure that you are under will only intensify.”

## 102, Christchurch man jailed for sharing video footage of massacre

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/18/christchurch-man-jailed-for-sharing-video-footage-of-massacre

> Philip Arps sentenced to 21 months for ‘glorifying and encouraging’ the mass shooting in New Zealand

A Christchurch businessman who shared a video of worshippers being shot dead at a New Zealand mosque was sentenced on Tuesday to 21 months in prison.

Philip Arps had earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of distributing the video, which was livestreamed on Facebook by a gunman on 15 March as he began the shooting at two mosques in which 51 people died.

Christchurch district court Judge Stephen O’Driscoll said that when questioned about the video, Arps had described it as “awesome” and had shown no empathy toward the victims.

The judge said Arps had strong and unrepentant views about the Muslim community and had, in effect, committed a hate crime. The judge said Arps had compared himself to Rudolf Hess, a Nazi leader under Adolf Hitler.

“Your offending glorifies and encourages the mass murder carried out under the pretext of religious and racial hatred,” the judge said.

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has helped lead a global pledge named the “Christchurch Call”, aimed at boosting efforts to keep internet platforms from being used to spread hate, organise extremist groups and broadcast attacks. New Zealand has also tightened its gun laws and banned certain types of semi-automatic weapons since the attack.

O’Driscoll said Arps had sent the video to 30 associates. The judge said Arps also asked somebody to insert crosshairs and include a kill count in order to create an internet meme, although there was no evidence he had shared the meme.

Under New Zealand laws aimed at preventing the distribution of objectionable material, Arps faced up to 14 years imprisonment on each count.

The judge said Arps had argued he had a right to distribute the video under the banner of freedom to pursue his political beliefs.

Arps’s lawyer Anselm Williams told the judge that Arps should not be sent to prison. “It’s my submission that this court needs to be very careful to sentence Mr Arps based on what it is that he has actually done, and what he accepts he has done, not on the basis of the views that he holds,” Williams said.

After the hearing, Williams said Arps had filed an appeal against his sentence at the high court, but declined to comment further.

## 103, New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern urged to act quickly to ban semi-automatic weapons

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/16/jacinda-ardern-urged-to-act-quickly-ban-semi-automatic-weapons

> PM must resist efforts by gun lobby to stop restrictions in the wake of Christchurch massacres, experts say

Gun control experts have urged New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern to act swiftly to enact stricter firearms laws in the wake of the Christchurch terror attack to prevent the pro-gun lobby from being able to weaken the reforms.

Ardern said on Saturday that she planned to reform gun laws and her government has already announced it will ban semi-automatic rifles.

She said the proposed reforms, which will be the focus of a cabinet meeting on Monday, will also focus on the ease with which legal weapons can be modified to become military-style assault rifles, which are more strictly controlled.

It follows the use of what is believed to be modified semi-automatic rifles in the massacres at the Al Noor and Linwood mosques on Friday which killed 49 people and injured 48 more, including two children under the age of five.

Arden told reporters on Saturday that the guns “appear to have been modified” and said that was “a challenge that we will look to address in changing our laws”.

NZ police commissioner Mike Bush told reporters that the guns used in the killing were able to be purchased legally under a “category-A” licence, which is the entry-level gun licence in New Zealand and does not require a licence holder to register their weapons.

However, the weapons were not legal as they were found by police after the attack.

“A category-A firearm holder can purchase the firearms without the magazines or the things that will enable them to be in the state that they were,” Bush said.

Brenton Tarrant, the Australian man arrested and charged in relation to the massacre, had held a category-A firearms licence since December 2017. He was alleged to have had five guns, including two semi-automatic rifles and two shotguns.

More than 2,000 firearms, including several types of semi-automatic rifle, can be legally purchased under a category-A licence.

University of Sydney gun control expert Philip Alpers, the founder of global site gunpolicy.org, said that semi-automatic rifles could be modified “very easily” into military-style semi-automatic rifles using a high-capacity magazine, the sale of which is not restricted in New Zealand. Military-style semi-automatic assault rifles are those with a magazine that holds or appears to hold more than 15 cartridges, for a .22 calibre rifle, or more than seven cartridges for a higher calibre rifle.

The sale of normal semi-automatic guns is not restricted in New Zealand. The same weapons can only be acquired by licensed professional hunters in Australia, and must be individually imported.

Under Australian law, all guns must be registered to a licensed-gun owner and automatic and semi-automatic weapons are banned.

“He would have found it very, very difficult to get these firearms in Australia,” Alpers said.

Alpers said that Ardern had the opportunity to introduce sweeping gun reform, starting with the restriction of semi-automatic rifles and the creation of a central gun register, provided she acted quickly.

“If Jacinda Ardern moves as quickly as [former Australian prime minister] John Howard did [when he banned guns following the 1996 Port Arthur massacre], and she does it in 12 days, the probability is that she will be able to do what she wants to do,” Alpers said.

The gun lobby is very strong in New Zealand, supported by the New Zealand First party and a number of rural MPs whose constituents do not want to lose access to the firearms they use for recreational hunting or as tools on farms.

Similar lobby groups opposed gun reform in Australia but were overridden by public safety concerns in the wake of Port Arthur.

Alpers said the gun lobby was unlikely to be able to mount an argument that the public would accept in the wake of the worst massacre in New Zealand’s recent history.

“I can’t imagine a country where it is less likely that they will just utter ‘thoughts and prayers’ and let it slide,” he said. “That won’t happen in New Zealand.”

New Zealand has a lower rate of gun crime in Australia, despite having three times the number of licensed gun owners per head of population.

“They are very proud of how their gun laws have worked,” Alpers said. “This will mark a profound change to New Zealand’s self-perception.”

Gun control advocate Professor Simon Chapman said a similar attack could only occur in Australia if the perpetrator was able to obtain “totally illegal weapons bought off an illegal market.”

“You can only speculate about why this person decided to go over to New Zealand to do what he did, but it is possibly because it was much easier for him to purchase the means to do it,” Chapman said.

## 104, 'I'm over it': will disillusioned voters spell trouble for Jacinda Ardern?

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/15/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-election-vote-disillusioned

> With seven months to go, the internationally acclaimed PM must tackle queries over whether she has done enough at home

It’s time for morning tea at the Allen Bryant retirement home in Hokitika, New Zealand, and a rattling tea cart is doing the rounds as the 50 residents talk politics. The South Island district is a Labour party stronghold, and the party was born up the road at the Blackball pub 100 years ago.

The residents who live at the home in the West Coast region are overwhelmingly Labour supporters, with backgrounds in mining and lifetime union affiliation. It was on the west coast that the party celebrated its centenary. And it is here that it is beginning to alienate its once-loyal fans.

Denis Pfahlert, 92, has voted Labour all his life and says the government has made the mistake of politicians the world over – it has over-promised and under-delivered. With the next election just seven months away, some members of Labour’s loyal base are questioning the government’s ability to improve the status quo.

“Have you ever known politicians to keep their promises? I’ve been around a long time and I haven’t,” Pfahlert says. “And this government’s turning out no different. She [Jacinda Ardern] is doing her best but all politicians talk too big, from Trump to Boris Johnson. Of course they disappoint us.”

Three years ago, Ardern was elected on a promise to “transform” New Zealand in the most exciting vote the country had seen in decades. The feminist credentials and strong social conscience of Ardern, a progressive young leader who emerged during a turbulent period in global history, appealed to voters after nine years of conservative leadership by John Key, an ex-Merrill Lynch financier who had a fondness for tugging women’s ponytails.

Ardern’s Labour coalition government promised to combat growing inequality, tackle climate change and address the housing crisis.

On the personal front, Ardern offered an alternative image for modern-day politics. Becoming pregnant with her first child while in office, the PM has led a top-down reform of working conditions for parents, including boosts to baby grants and extensions to paid parental leave. Her government passed a zero-carbon act with bipartisan support, and introduced 10 days of paid leave for people escaping domestic violence, as well as making strangulation – a strong predictor of later homicide – a separate offence.

Following her now-famous response to the Christchurch terrorist attacks on 15 March, Ardern peaked in the polls with 51% approval as prime minister. Wearing a hijab, she was unwavering in her rejection of the gunman’s white supremacist ideology and quick to enact legislation banning assault and semi-automatic rifles just six weeks after the attack.

But in the months after Christchurch, Ardern’s popularity slipped, and confidence in Labour’s victory at September’s general election is being questioned. The latest Colmar Brunton poll has National polling ahead of Labour at 46%, with Ardern’s party at 41%. The prime minister has also slipped as preferred leader from her peak post-Christchurch and now stands at 42%, though this still puts her streets ahead of her rivals.

Anu Kaloti, 51, of Auckland, campaigns on behalf of migrant workers and says the government needs to be given some leeway after “the mess” of nine years of National party rule. However, she is disappointed by its performance and says Ardern’s status as an international humanitarian is not translating into better lives for Kiwis at home.

“After 15 March she has become an icon internationally, and that’s all very well, we feel proud of that, but what kind of delivery are we getting domestically?” Kaloti says. “I feel disillusioned. While it looks really good internationally, I’m seeing that as good marketing. We need more at home. There’s responsibilities here.”

Political commentator Bryce Edwards believes the Labour coalition government has not proved to voters that it is radically different from the previous National party government, despite its promises.

“Delivery has been the biggest issue for this government. They have failed on delivering on their big promises of inequality and housing,” Edwards says. “Labour may struggle to mobilise their fanbase come the next election; people are beginning to suspect this government is more interested in style over substance. And the gloss has definitely come off Ardern.”

Moreen Price, 85, also of Hokitika, doesn’t plan to vote in the election. Although she likes Ardern personally – “she’s really nice, she’s open, she seems to get on with everybody” – she hasn’t seen any change under Labour. “I don’t think they [Labour] are trying to be different. They’re all just the same in the end. They promise things but they never fulfil them. I’m over it, really.”

While Ardern’s global appeal – and her personal appeal inside New Zealand – has not wavered, it has been a brutal few months domestically for her party. A sexual assault scandal in the Labour party tarnished the prime minister’s image as a champion of women’s rights and the #MeToo movement and ate away at her most prized asset, trust.

Before that, the government was struggling to contain a housing crisis. Edwards, like most commentators, cites the government’s failure to address the affordability crunch as among its biggest problems. It has halted the sale of public housing and banned foreign buyers, but the wait for a state house is at a record high and tens of millions of dollars are being spent on emergency motel rooms to house the growing homeless population.

The government’s flagship housing policy, KiwiBuild, has been a disaster, with just 286 affordable homes built in over a year when the target was 100,000 in a decade, and many sit empty and unsold in wealthy resort towns where there was no demand for them.

Restrictive and time-consuming building regulations, the high cost of land and a shortage of skilled labourers also contributed to the failure of the scheme. The high cost of the homes billed as “affordable” also turned off people, with two-bedroom homes going for upwards of NZ$500,000.

The housing minister, Megan Woods, described KiwiBuild’s agenda as “overly ambitious”, a charge that is increasingly being levelled at the government across its key portfolios.

The government has a record number of Māori MPs in its ranks, but the Indigenous political commentator Morgan Godfery says it – and Ardern – have let down the country’s Indigenous people, who are over-represented in poor socio-economic outcomes and account for more than 50% of the prison population, despite accounting for only 14% of the general population.

“The government simply haven’t shown up on Māori issues; they have been absent,” Godfery says. “Ardern’s rhetoric is very hard to match with her actions.”

Ardern’s winning card, however, may be the striking unpopularity of her opponent, the leader of the National party, Simon Bridges.

Godfery describes Bridges as “no match” for Ardern, while Edwards says the National party leader is developing distinctly “Trumpian” overtones in his combative, adversarial style of politics. Bridges consistently polls far below Ardern, frequently polling less than 10% as preferred PM. His most recent ranking in the Colmar Brunton poll was 11%, to Ardern’s 42%.

Political commentator Ben Thomas says Ardern’s dip in popularity is not surprising, and her biggest advantage remains her sustained popularity over Bridges. “Labour will expect that [her popularity over Bridges] to pay off during the campaign when they’re put head to head for six weeks.

“Her real concern will be the erosion of her personal advantages, for example her focus on positivity and kindness, if New Zealand First continues to be surrounded by controversy into the campaign and she’s seen as condoning it or not being able to manage it,” he said, referring to Labour’s coalition partner.

Pfahlert in Hokitika expresses a sentiment common across all sides of the political spectrum when he describes Bridges simply as “hopeless”. “He hasn’t got a clue – he just reacts.” And although Ardern has disappointed him, he thinks she might deserve another chance – and that giving Labour a second term in office may help the party deliver.

In 2017, after taking power, Ardern declared that “New Zealanders have voted against the status quo”. She will hope that this time around at the ballot box, she has done enough to convince them to accept it.

Good morning, I’m Tim Walker with today’s essential stories.

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has unveiled a sweeping and immediate ban on assault rifles and military-style semi-automatic weapons in response to last week’s Christchurch mosque attacks, the deadliest mass shooting in the country’s modern history. “The time for the mass and easy availability of these weapons must end and today they will,” Ardern said as she announced details of the nationwide ban, which came into effect at 3pm local time on Thursday.

Mosque reopens. Thousands of people are expected to attend prayers at Al Noor mosque in Christchurch when it reopens on Friday, a week after the attacks in which 50 people were killed, 42 of them at Al Noor mosque.

With UK lawmakers still locked in disagreement over Brexit, Theresa May has formally requested a three-month delay to the UK’s departure from the EU – and blamed the squabbling in parliament for the postponement. Speaking from Downing Street on Wednesday night, the prime minister described the developments as “a matter of great personal regret”. Despite a furious backlash from MPs, May made clear she intended to make yet another attempt at forcing her Brexit deal through the House of Commons next week.

EU view. After receiving May’s formal letter requesting the extension, the European council president, Donald Tusk, said the EU would only agree to the short delay if MPs voted to accept May’s deal next week.

Donald Trump’s favourite new talking point is a familiar one: his dislike for John McCain. In attacks that drew criticism even from Republicans, the president criticised the late senator seven months after his death. “I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve,” Trump grumbled on a visit to Ohio. “I didn’t get a thank you.” In a tweet, he complained about McCain’s vote against repealing Obamacare, which he also called “disgraceful” during a White House appearance on Tuesday.

Team McCain. Several Republicans defended McCain against the president, including Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney. McCain’s daughter Meghan McCain, a host on The View, said: “Attacking someone who isn’t here is a bizarre low.”

The 2020 Democratic presidential field is unusual in its size and diversity, and also its willingness to discuss an idea that has rarely reached the forefront of American political discourse: reparations to the descendants of slaves. The Rev Jesse Jackson, who has long argued for reparations, told the Guardian: “If they deal with this, it can’t be superficial … It requires a serious study of history. It requires serious scientific study.”

Where they stand. Of the 2020 candidates, Elizabeth Warren and Julián Castro have expressed tentative support for reparations, while Kamala Harris and Cory Booker propose alternative solutions to the lingering legacy of slavery.

Hundreds of drilling projects on Wyoming public land have been halted after a judge in Washington DC ruled that the Trump administration failed to take climate change into account when it approved the leases to the energy industry.

Lockerbie investigators are reported to be questioning at least five former agents of the East German Stasi about their possible role in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103, in which 270 people were killed.

South Korean police have arrested two men for secretly filming 1,600 guests at 30 hotels in multiple cities and streaming the footage live online, amid an epidemic of such sexual voyeurism videos, known as molka.

Devin Nunes’ Cow, a parody Twitter account mocking the titular California congressman, now has more followers than Nunes himself, after he drew attention to it by launching a defamation lawsuit against Twitter.

The secret business of shipping priceless art

Even the most committed art lover may not have put much thought into how the works in an exhibition came to be there. Andrew Dickson untangles the intricate logistical web that helps to move masterpieces across borders and on to museum walls.

Trudeau’s Montréal base eroded by scandal

Justin Trudeau has always relied on the staunch support of voters in Montréal, the city that still celebrates his father and prime ministerial predecessor, Pierre. But the so-called “Lavscam” bribery scandal engulfing the Canadian government has taken a toll there too, as Martin Patriquin reports.

Has Pixar forked up Toy Story?

The first full-length trailer for Toy Story 4 landed online this week, featuring a major new character named Forky, a neurotic spork-turned-toy who’s suffering an existential crisis. Ben Child worries that the classic franchise might just be retreading old territory.

How prosecutors vilify police shooting victims

After Stephon Clark was shot dead by police in his grandmother’s Sacramento backyard, the district attorney launched an assault on his memory. The families of police violence victims tell Sam Levin how prosecutors smear their loved ones to exonerate their killers.

Purdue Pharma, the purveyors of Oxycontin, could be sunk by the flood of lawsuits over its role in the opioids crisis. But pinning the blame for the worst drug epidemic in US history on a single firm would be a mistake, argues Chris McGreal.

Purdue may have kicked open the door to a crisis officially estimated to have claimed 350,000 lives, but the epidemic escalated over the past two decades because the medical industry in control of America’s healthcare system made it happen.

The Canterbury Crusaders are the most successful team in the history of Super Rugby, the southern hemisphere’s international club competition. But in the wake of the Christchurch shootings, which took place less than two miles from their stadium, they are considering a name change.

## 106, Jacinda Ardern pushes stability over change in New Zealand's 'Covid election'

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/09/can-anything-stop-the-high-flying-jacinda-ardern

> The prime minister is pitching a mix of steady leadership and big-spending policies to voters after a world-leading coronavirus response

Covid report: New Zealand goes 100 days without local transmission


On her first public outing since launching her party’s election campaign the day before, New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, spent Sunday morning at a farmers’ market in central Auckland where she walked among friends, posed for selfies and did her vegetable shopping.

Ardern is riding high in the polls – as is the Labour party – on the back of her stewardship of the country’s Covid-19 response. Her strong position has been aided by troubles within the opposition National party, which is heading into September’s election with its third leader in as many months.

Consequently, Labour is running a steady-as-she-goes campaign, anchored on New Zealand’s success as one of the few countries in the world to contain the Covid-19 pandemic and the personal popularity of the prime minister.

In 2017, the party campaigned on a need for change. The message this time is that changing the driver in a time of crisis is dangerous.

At the market in Grey Lynn, a trendy suburb known to be liberal left, not one person raised their voice against her. Instead, they queued for selfies.

Trust, and economic management of the fallout yet to come from Covid-19, are likely to be key factors when New Zealanders go to the polls, according to views expressed by those at the market.

“I think it is going to be fought on personality, record and who the public feels most comfortable with leading through the next period, where things perhaps have never been less certain,” said shopper Jerry Rickman.

“Economically the worst is to come and trust is a big issue. The election will be fought on her leadership. People admire [Ardern] irrespective of their political views. She’s done a wonderful job in terms of leadership on a number of tragic issues that have faced New Zealand and the world. I think she gets tremendous benefit there.”

Ardern looked relaxed as she bought a takeaway coffee and filled bags she’d brought from home. Her wide smile was replaced by a furrowed brow as she listened to stories of how people had coped when the country locked down from late March to early June.

Free-range egg vendor Carl Ebbers told Ardern he feared the worst when his usual outlets – greengrocers and cafes – had to close. However, online orders took off. “Community groups and friends and family got together to help and I sold a lot of eggs directly to people as well,” he said.

“I think the election will come down to trust, and that of course favours the incumbent prime minister. She’s done so well with Covid and all these emergencies we’ve had, the mosque attacks [in Christchurch].”

Ardern’s standing in the eyes of Kiwis has soared this year. Polls in January suggested Labour was headed for a contested result or even a narrow loss but fresh surveys show the party, currently in coalition with New Zealand First, may be able to govern outright.

Labour’s internal numbers indicate the arrival of Covid-19 to New Zealand coincided with the party’s largest surge of support in decades. The party is banking on Kiwis’ belief that the Ardern-led government can take the credit for eliminating community transmission, and trust in the prime minister to manage the economy through the recovery.

“When people ask, is this a Covid election, my answer is yes, it is,” Ardern told her supporters in Auckland Saturday. The prime minister has said no one wants it to be, “but it has been our new reality, and one that the team of 5 million have made work in the most extraordinary way”.

The centrepiece promise of Saturday’s campaign launch was another new scheme to support employment: a $NZ310m pledge to underwrite 40,000 jobs. It is a government spend-up, possibly without precedent in this country, described by a political commentator as “going full Roosevelt”.

Ardern’s market walkabout came as New Zealand chalked up 100 days without a case of community transmission of Covid-19, and its fourth day without a new case in managed isolation, in marked contrast to Australia and many other countries.

Speaking to reporters at the market, Ardern emphasised the need for caution despite achieving that “milestone”. Countries facing a second wave of infections showed how difficult the pandemic is to manage.

Though not currently required to wear masks, Kiwis are being asked to be prepared by adding them to their emergency kits. Ardern has said she wouldn’t hesitate to halt her election campaign and lock the country down again if community transmission returns.

Rcently installed opposition leader Judith Collins has described the contest between herself and Ardern as between “someone who knows how to lead” and someone who “basically just communicates really well”.

But market-goer Dan Salmon said Ardern had earned her high level of trust, and criticism of Labour’s ability to manage the economy rang hollow.

Caryn Truppman, who described the prime minister as “a fantastic leader”, hoped she had “the gumption to make changes rather than people like Judith Collins and [former MP] John Key wanting rich people to come and buy houses in New Zealand. What sort of solution is that?”

To David Williams, manager of the Grey Lynn Community Centre which hosts the farmers’ market, Ardern had made the most of every situation. “Crises give politicians opportunities and she has dealt with them well and now she has a global reputation.

“I have female friends in the UK who she has become a totem for. When you compare her leadership with all the white male entitled leadership around the world, she is a shining light.

“When the election comes, that’s going to be a significant positive factor for the Labour party.”

Williams said wage subsidies rolled out by the government from March – and extended to September – kept the community centre (and his football club) afloat.

The National party’s focus on roads in its transport policy was lampooned by Ardern’s husband, television personality Clarke Gayford, in a speech introducing his wife to party faithful at the Labour Party’s campaign launch.

In his tribute to the prime minister, recently voted the “world’s most eloquent leader”, he said the last time they had a test of wills at home, he soon found himself floundering. “In a desperate bid to end it, I announced three new roads and a tunnel.”

## 107, Questions raised about New Zealand's gun buyback scheme as amnesty ends

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/questions-raised-about-new-zealands-gun-buyback-scheme-as-amnesty-ends

> The program, introduced after the Christchurch massacre in March, has removed 56,000 guns from circulation

New Zealand’s ambitious firearm amnesty ends on Friday with questions over its success, as critics say the police only managed to collect about a third of the weapons that were outlawed after the Christchurch massacre.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern banned semi-automatic weapons and launched a gun amnesty and buyback scheme earlier this year, after a March shooting in Christchurch where a man is accused of gunning down 51 Muslims in two mosques.

More than 56,346 prohibited guns have been removed from circulation so far, within the range estimated by consultancy KPMG in an independent report, police minister Stuart Nash said in a statement.

“However police have consistently warned the problem is we just don’t know exactly how many guns are out in the community,” Nash said.

Ardern is pushing a new set of gun reforms through parliament which includes the creation of a registry to monitor every firearm legally held in New Zealand.

Nash said about 31,650 people had taken part in the amnesty so far and almost NZ$100 million ($66.1 million) had been paid in compensation to gun owners.

Almost 188,000 prohibited gun parts were also surrendered. Nash said after today gun owners would not be paid for their prohibited firearms.

“Those in breach of the law face risk of prosecution and up to five years jail, as well as the loss of their licence,” he said.

Voluntary surrender of firearms would continue. Opposition leaders and gun lobby groups called the amnesty a failure.

“Its not a number to be boasting about. It’s not successful,” Council of Licensed Firearms Owners (COLFO) spokeswoman Nicole McKee told reporters.

The council estimates 170,000 semi-automatic weapons were in circulation before the amnesty was announced.

“Despite our best efforts to encourage compliance, we know owners have been so disappointed by the settings of the ban and its poor implementation that many can’t bring themselves to comply,” McKee said in a statement.

The opposition National Party said the amnesty had collected less than a third of what police and firearm stakeholders had previously advised could be out there.

“The government made a mistake in targeting law-abiding firearms owners when they should’ve targeted the gangs who peddle misery in communities across New Zealand,” said Mark Mitchell, National party spokesman.

## 108, Jacinda Ardern faces Waitangi Day reckoning with Māori as progress stalls

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/01/jacinda-ardern-faces-waitangi-day-reckoning-with-maori-as-progress-stalls

> Three years after the prime minister asked Māori to hold her to account, many are disillusioned with her government

In an oft-repeated story New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has recalled how growing up in the small, largely Māori town of Murupara, she would see children going to school hungry, and with no shoes on their feet.

It was these scenes of entrenched inequality and poverty, often along racial lines, that drove a teenage Ardern into the Labour party, where she has dedicated herself to combating child poverty.

But fast-forward to the second term of the Labour government and Indigenous political experts say Ardern’s track record in tackling systemic Māori disadvantage has been underwhelming. Despite a record number of Māori MPs in government, little has changed in the appalling socio-economic statistics that reflect the lives of New Zealand’s Indigenous people.

“Among Māori there seems to be an increasingly clear understanding that we can’t wait for the government to meet our needs any more,” says Garrick Cooper, a senior lecturer at the school of Māori and Indigenous studies at the University of Canterbury.

“I don’t think any of our government institutions can transform to the degree they need to to meet the needs of the Māori community, and that’s ignoring the question of whether there’s a will in government [at all].”

Waitangi Day, at this stage still slated to go ahead in Northland on the 6 February, celebrates the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi between Māori chiefs and British colonisers in 1840.

But modern-day Waitangi has become a reckoning between the crown and its Indigenous treaty partners, with protests common and bottomless promises from politicians to improve Indigenous wellbeing.

Over the years many politicians have chosen not to attend – fearful of protest and acrimony – and in 1990, Queen Elizabeth was greeted with a mixture of cheering and boos, as well as having a black T-shirt thrown at her by a young Māori woman.

Promising change, Ardern swept into Waitangi in 2018 for an unprecedented five-day visit – the longest of any prime minister.

Ngāpuhi, the local tribe, showed respect to Ardern by allowing her to speak on the marae (meeting ground) – the first female prime minister to be granted that right – and also invited her to bury the placenta of her baby on tribal grounds.

Memorably, Ardern asked the people gathered at Waitangi to hold her government to account, particularly regarding its commitments to lift Māori children out of poverty, create more jobs and reduce the high incarceration rate of Māori.

The first 49 seconds of her speech were delivered in te reo, the Māori language, a skill she said she would like to improve.

“When we return, in one year, in three years, I ask you to ask of us what we have done …. Ask us, hold us to account,” she said. “Because one day I want to be able to tell my child that I earned the right to stand here, and only you can tell me when I have done that.”

But three years on, and many Māori are feeling disillusioned at the progress of their treaty partner, despite some wins, such as the appointment of Māori woman Nanaia Mahuta as foreign minister, and the growth of the flourishing Whānau Ora, a culturally based, and whānau-centred, government social agency.

The proportion of of the prison population made up by Indigenous people remains stubbornly high – at more than 50%, despite representing only 16% of the general population – and Māori make up 65% of children in state care.

Māori are also routinely over-represented in poor health and mortality outcomes across the board, in addition to facing entrenched issues of poverty, homelessness and drug and alcohol abuse.

The human rights commissioner, Meng Foon, who speaks fluent Māori, recently said racism was “alive and well” in New Zealand. Indeed, racism has been entrenched in many institutions. Media giant Stuff issued a public apology last year for its past portrayal of Māori, which it said had ranged from blinkered to racist until the present day.

But in government change has been much slower, and experts say a series of crises in Labour’s first-term stalled their efforts towards tackling Indigenous issues, including the March 2019 mosque attacks in Christchurch, the global pandemic, and the eruption of the Whakaari White Island volcano.

Usually renowned for her warmth and human touch, Ardern’s stand-back approach on pivotal Indigenous issues has also communicated to many that she’s reluctant to be drawn into the maelstrom of modern-day Māori politics.

The occupation of Ihumātao by Māori activists wanting to reclaim tribal land from private property developers galvanised a new generation of young Māori – but Ardern never showed, despite months of pleas by locals.

Likewise, when the row over the removal of Māori babies from their mothers blew up after a 2019 Newsroom report, Ardern staunchly refused to comment or intervene, or even watch the video of a Māori infant being taken from its mother in a North Island hospital by police and social services.

And on the controversial police armed response teams, which disproportionately target Māori communities, Ardern was silent, saying their deployment was an “operational issue”.

“Her Māori MPs, you could tell they were really uncomfortable when they eventually turned up at Ihumātao,” says Cooper.

“Because Jacinda would not go. She was in Christchurch in a flash, she was at Whakaari in a flash, and we’d hope and expect that she’d be at Ihumātao. But instead she was very wary, and she remains very wary.”

The Labour party have drawn Māori support for decades, but Cooper notes that the most significant treaty of Waitangi settlements have actually occurred under the National party.

The trust between Māori and any New Zealand government is more fragile than ever, says Cooper, and despite a certain amount of feel-good warmth on display in recent years at Waitangi, structural change, or a “by Māori, for Māori” approach, is farther away than ever.

“Māori need to drive the transformation for change, and government need to understand that their role is supporting us – not telling us how to do it,” Cooper says.

The transformational change promised by Ardern has been a let-down for many New Zealanders. They expected to see massive policy overhauls in the realm of the environment, housing and child poverty, and have instead seen minor, sometimes imperceptible, tweaks.

Dr Lara Greaves, a lecturer in New Zealand politics at the University of Auckland, says Indigenous wellbeing has suffered the same fate under Labour as under previous governments, and that ultimately “there were no giant leap forwards on Māori policy or equality”.

“Labour have that mandate for transformational change and that needs to happen,” she said. But that is “quite scary” for them and their “broad church” of middle New Zealand supporters, she added.

“Otherwise, at this point, it’s really not clear what Labour want to do in terms of their long-term legacy.”

For Kelvin Davis, the government’s minister for Māori crown relations and a Ngāpuhi man, trust is something to be garnered slowly.

“The question is, who has crossed the bridge from that world to the other the most? and it’s almost exclusively been Māori … we’ve learnt the English language, the custom, the laws – the question is how many people have crossed over from te ao Pakeha to te ao Maori? It has happened, but it’s very rare,” Davis said.

“My vision is that hopefully in the not too distant future people can just cross from one world into the other, at will; totally comfortable, flipping in and out of languages as they see fit. That to me is a vision of Aotearoa into the future.”

## 109, Christchurch inquiry report released – as it happened

https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/dec/08/christchurch-shooting-royal-commission-report-to-be-released-live

>  This blog is now closed. 

Below are is our summary of today’s key findings. With that, we will now be closing this blog. Thank you for following along.

Here is our full story on the report’s findings:

More from AAP:

Commissioners interviewed the Grafton-raised man, who is serving a lifetime sentence for the terror attack, as part of the 18-month investigation.

The report states the terrorist was “limited and on occasion non-existent” in his responses, and in some instances, answers to questions were not believed.

“That said, much of what he said was credible ... it provided insights into his activities and thinking,” it read.

The report states the terrorist expressed racist ideas from an early age, which first manifested as anti-Semitic and anti-Aboriginal comments at school.

The terrorist had few childhood or adult friends and did not work for seven years leading up to the terror act, financing travel abroad and to NZ using a payout from his father’s work-related exposure to asbestos.

From 2014 to 2017, the terrorist embarked on a worldwide tour, taking in south-east Asia, North Korea, central Asia and Europe, finishing up in Ethiopia.

The Royal Commission finds that the terrorist’s mobilisation to violence occurred in 2017, and that prior to this, he “travelled widely because he could and had nothing better to do”.

The report also found the terrorist was radicalised on YouTube, the Google-owned video sharing-platform.

Jacinda Ardern said she would seek out company leaders to discuss its role in the terrorist’s pathway to mass murder, after being shocked to learn of YouTube’s role, AAP reports. 

“What particularly stood out was the statement that the terrorist made that he was ‘not a frequent commentator on extreme right-wing sites and YouTube was a significant source of information and inspiration’,” she said.

“This is a point I plan to make directly to the leadership of YouTube.”

The terrorist made donations to far-right organisations and also frequented an extremist Facebook group called ‘The Lads Society’.

The report lists posts made by the terrorist to that group, including complaints over Muslim immigration and threats of violence towards local immigrants.

In January 2019, the terrorist was visited by his Australian-based mother in New Zealand.

She would later tell the Australian Federal Police she was “petrified” by his mental health and racism.

As we reported earlier, the report found the gunman was treated in hospital months before the attack after accidentally shooting himself.

The report has recommended that “mandatory reporting of firearms injuries to New Zealand Police by health professionals” be introduced.

The report’s recommendations (in full here) fall under four themes:

The full report has just been published online here.

The foreword begins:

We start by acknowledging whānau of the 51 shuhada, and the survivors and witnesses of the 15 March 2019 terrorist attack and their whānau whose lives have been forever changed. Those attacked at the masjidain were New Zealanders who had gathered together in peaceful prayer. The terrorist murdered 51 people and attempted to murder a further 40 people. His brutal actions were deplorable and incomprehensible.

The report also found the gunman was treated in hospital months before the attack after accidentally shooting himself. This from Stuff.NZ:

Medical staff never alerted police to his injuries.

At the time, there was no mandatory legislation regarding reporting gunshot wounds, but it is understood to be a recommendation made by the royal commission of inquiry into the attack, which will release its findings on Tuesday.

It is understood Dunedin doctors also treated the Australian-born shooter, who would become New Zealand’s first convicted terrorist, for issues arising from his steroid use.

The Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand (IWCNZ) have said in a statement that “justice has not been done served by the report”, which they say was severely restricted by its terms of reference.

There was a lack of transparency under the guise of confidentiality and national security, the IWCNZ says.

“There are multiple areas of evidence that have not been investigated, and questions raised by IWCNZ have been ignored.”

“We find it concerning that the Commissioners found systemic failures and an inappropriate concentration of resources towards Islamic terrorism, and yet state that these would not have made a difference to the terrorist being detected prior to the event.”

In August this year, before the gunman was sentenced to life in prison, Hamimah Tuyan, the widow of the 51st and final victim of 2019’s Christchurch shooting, also addressed the gunman in court, telling him her husband’s death elevated him from hero to martyr.

Zekeriya Tuyan battled for 48 days after 18 surgeries before succumbing to his injuries:

Are you in or from Aotearoa?

How do you feel about the report finally being released?

Let us know on Twitter @helenrsullivan.

Among the other initial measures Ardern has announced are:

Here is what we know about the report so far:

Key findings:

Key recommendations:

Reactions to the report: 

Ardern announced on Monday that she would appoint a new minister to implement the inquiry’s recommendations, telling reporters:

The [Muslim] community will want to see accountability in terms of the implementation, they will want to know who is responsible for coordinating some of those efforts and we will be providing that”

My colleague Phil Taylor reports that the 800-page document has that the terrorist’s “operational security”; the laws the security agencies work with; and the limited capability and capacity of the agencies were also factors.

The only information that should have alerted authorities to the terrorist attack was an email he sent to parliament eight minutes before beginning the attack.

Secrecy about counter-terrorism approaches by successive governments had consequences, the report said:

One reason for this was to avoid stigmatising Muslims. But had such a strategy been shared with the public and also incorporated a ‘see something, say something policy’, it is possible that aspects of the individual’s planning may … have been reported.

With the benefit of hindsight, such reporting would have provided the best chance of disrupting the terrorist attack.”

Stuff.NZ has laid out some more of the precautions taken – and suppression rulings made – by the commission:

The commission had to take care its processes or report could not be used for unlawful activities or damage the public interest. It made a series of suppression rulings including suppressing the names of police staff involved in granting the Australian national a firearms licence and the two people who vouched for the terrorist.

An interview with the terrorist was also permanently suppressed because of a concern it would be used by others to plan attacks and further spread the terrorist’s views. Evidence and documents provided by government agencies were kept secret for similar reasons.

The commissioners also decided the evidence provided by Government agency chief executives and current and former Cabinet ministers should be suppressed for 30 years, allowing public release in the future when national security concerns ‘dissipate’.”

The Royal Commission includes swathes of information previously classified as top secret, and material gathered from hundreds of interviews - including with the terrorist, ministers past and present, public service agency heads and affected communities.

Many interviews, including with Ms Ardern, are subject to 30-year suppressions.

The interview with the terrorist has been permanently classified.

The report’s recommendations include a new security and intelligence agency, a new counter-terrorism minister and strategy, and funding for research into NZ-specific extremism, AAP reports. 

They also include new anti-terror laws, hate speech laws, social cohesion measures and workplace diversity for the public sector.

The challenging report also gives more details on the upbringing of the Australian terrorist.

The Royal Commission noted the attack “was driven by an extreme right-wing Islamophobic ideology. Its purpose was to promote chaos and disharmony in New Zealand”.

It said “this purpose failed”.

“In the days, weeks and months that followed, New Zealanders united around those affected and spoke out against racism, extremism and extremist violence,” the report read.

“There was a period of national reflection about our shared values, our collective lives and what it means to live in New Zealand.

The imam of the Masjid An-Nur (Al Noor mosque), Gamal Fouda, the spokesman for the Muslim Association of Canterbury, Abdigani Ali, and general secretary of the Linwood Islamic Centre, Faisal Sayed, have said in a statement:

“We’ve known for a long time that the Muslim community has been targeted with hate speech and hate crimes – this report shows that we are right.”

The leaders added that the report, “shows that institutional prejudice and unconscious bias exists in government agencies and that needs to change.”

## 111, Jacinda Ardern: 'Political leaders can be both empathetic and strong'

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/jacinda-ardern-political-leaders-can-be-both-empathetic-and-strong

> In this book extract, the New Zealand PM says too much focus on power and strength means leaders can lose sight of the need for kindness

Tell us a little about yourself.

My name is Jacinda Ardern and I’m the prime minister of New Zealand. And I’m the third female prime minister, the second youngest, and the youngest female prime minister.

You were 17 when you joined the Labour party in New Zealand?

Yes, I joined a political party when I was a teenager and for me it wasn’t because I thought a life in politics was for me. Absolutely no! In fact, if anything, I thought it looked like a very hard life. It was because I was one of those young people that thought I’d like to change the world, even if it was in the smallest of ways, it just felt like I was doing something that would make a difference.

At 17 did you imagine ever that you would become prime minister?

Until the day before I became prime minister I couldn’t have imagined becoming prime minister! And in part that’s because I’m a New Zealander and we are naturally quite a self-deprecating people, and part, if I’m honest, it’s probably because I’m also a woman who looks more quickly at my deficits; the things that I’m not good at, rather than what I am. But either way, I never would have imagined as a child that I would end up doing a role like this, because I grew up in a very small town, and there are 120 MPs (members of parliament) in New Zealand. How could I possibly imagine being one of them?

You’ve become an internationally famous person, a role model for many around the world, but it was just over three years ago that the then leader of the Labour party called you into his office and said, “I don’t think I can get there,” and said that he wanted to place his trust in you. I remember that first press conference.

… So do I!

… the impact you made, and the authority and confidence you brought to that moment. I think many people around New Zealand felt that perhaps you didn’t have enough experience, or that you were too young. What gave you the confidence to suddenly step forward?

You’re absolutely right. It was my birthday when the leader of the political party that I was then deputy leader of, said to me, “I don’t think I can get the numbers up in order for us to win the election.” It was seven weeks away and I remember being absolutely adamant [saying], “You have to stay.” I thought we needed to be consistent and that people wouldn’t appreciate us losing a leader so close to an election, but he’d made his mind up. And at that point I thought, “Well, he’s decided, now I just need to get on with it.” There wasn’t a question in my mind that now I had a job to do and that I could do it. You know it’s one thing to not be able to necessarily imagine yourself in that position, but when you’re there you’re just actually thinking, “Right, there’s no time for me to second-guess myself now, people don’t need to hear me question anything right now, they just need to know, and hear me say, ‘I can’.” And so, in that moment, I absolutely knew I could and so it was just a matter of going out there and showing that.

You’ve talked about that moment in terms of trusting your instincts. Was that something you trusted before you got into this?

Yes. I don’t know what I would do in this role or in politics without having instincts that I trust. Now that doesn’t mean that I choose to ignore evidence and research – that’s very, very important to me, to make evidence-informed decisions – but actually you just can’t ignore what your instincts are telling you; nor should you. I think one of the dangers of leadership now, and particularly in politics, is that we have so much information now, and so much research around the way that people think, and the way they process what they hear, and how we’re meant to present ourselves, that you run the risk of becoming over-engineered. And I think, if there’s anything that people need right now, is they just need to see human beings doing their best as leaders. And that means that from time to time you’ll stumble, and you should be honest about that; it means that people will see your failings and we should be honest about that too. People need authenticity, not, I think, some manufactured idea of what political leadership is meant to be.

If you were to summarise the qualities that have underpinned your path to this leadership role, what do you think has been most important for you?

Kindness, and not being afraid to be kind, or to focus on, or be really driven by empathy. I think one of the sad things that I’ve seen in political leadership is – because we’ve placed over time so much emphasis on notions of assertiveness and strength – that we probably have assumed that it means you can’t have those other qualities of kindness and empathy. And yet, when you think about all the big challenges that we face in the world, that’s probably the quality we need the most. We need our leaders to be able to empathise with the circumstances of others; to empathise with the next generation that we’re making decisions on behalf of. And if we focus only on being seen to be the strongest, most powerful person in the room, then I think we lose what we’re meant to be here for. So I’m proudly focused on empathy, because you can be both empathetic and strong.

What are the biggest lessons you’ve learned as a leader?

That you won’t necessarily get tougher. When I first came into politics I remember talking to a member of parliament who I thought was quite a tough cookie, and asking him, “How did you, how do you, build your thick skin?”. He was horrified that I thought that he was like that! He said stuff still got to him, and that actually if stuff ever stopped getting to you then you’d probably lost your empathy, and it was never worth losing that. And so, I actually decided I didn’t necessarily want to build some tough exterior. Instead I just learned how to filter things; how to kind of take on board that criticism and listen to it when I needed to, or otherwise say, “Well, actually that person’s just coming from a very different perspective”, and just learn how to filter it. And so that was a really big learning curve, you know? Actually, the world doesn’t need a whole lot of massively thickskinned politicians; they do need people who care. The odd sensitive flower is OK.

Can you describe a key moment or crisis that has particularly tested you as a leader?

Yes, the 15th of March [2019]. That was when New Zealand, for the first time in its modern history, experienced a horrific terrorist attack in the Muslim community. Fifty-one people lost their lives.

Tell us a little about your process and feelings around that time. How did you work out how you, as a leader, were supposed to react? What you could do?

You know, I don’t ever remember thinking about how I was meant to react or what it was I was meant to be. The only thing I did remember thinking, was that I knew I couldn’t show every emotion that I was feeling; that wasn’t what everyone needed. They really just wanted to hear what everyone else was thinking.

I’ve always said I felt like all I did at that time was just reflect back what I was seeing, and amongst this horrific human tragedy I just saw this outpouring of grief and love for a community who gave that all back in return. And that was one of the things I think to this day remains the most staggering for me in all of this, that not even 24 hours after the shooting I went to Christchurch and sat face to face with some of the people who, the day before, were in the media covered in blood having been right there where this massacre occurred, and as they stood up I just couldn’t imagine what they were going to say. I thought it might be anger, but they stood and said, “Thank you”. They thanked New Zealanders. Twenty-four hours later they were thanking us for our response to the community, and that was both devastating and also had me in awe; that a community could be so forgiving.

And so really, from there, that just said to me, “Well, who are we to display anything other than love and kindness under those circumstances”, and that’s what New Zealand did.

## 112, New Zealand stabbings: man shot dead by police after ‘terrorist attack’ in Auckland

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/03/man-shot-dead-in-new-zealand-after-injuring-people-in-supermarket-police-say

> Jacinda Ardern says attack was carried out by a ‘violent extremist’ who followed Islamic State ideology and was being monitored by police

An attack at a New Zealand supermarket was “a terrorist attack” by a “violent extremist” who follows Islamic State ideology and who had been under heavy surveillance by police, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said.

A man was shot dead on Friday afternoon by police after entering a West Auckland supermarket and stabbing at least six people, who are now in hospital.

The alleged terrorist was a Sri Lankan national who arrived in New Zealand in 2011 and became a person of national security interest from 2016, authorities said.

Ardern said his ideology was IS-inspired, but he was a “lone-wolf”.

“What happened today was despicable. It was hateful, it was wrong, it was carried out by an individual, not a faith, not a culture, not an ethnicity, but an individual person who was gripped by ideology that is not supported here by anyone or any community.

Ardern and police commissioner Andrew Coster said nothing gave the police any reason to believe there was any further threat or risk to the public.

“We have dealt with that person. We know from our extensive monitoring that he was acting alone,” Coster said.

The prime minister said she was aware of the man prior to Friday’s attack, and he had been under surveillance for some time.

“By the time he entered the supermarket, he was being watched and followed. The police were with him at the time this happened – that level of surveillance was being provided because of the concerns that we had,” Ardern said.

“The detailed reasons he is known to the agencies is the subject of suppression orders made by the court. In my view, it is in the public interest to hear as much as we can, in this case, I’m seeking advice on what we can do to facilitate that sharing of information as soon as possible,” Ardern said.

“Of all of the tools that we have, constant monitoring and surveillance is – outside someone being in prison – one of the strongest we have, and that is what was attached to this individual,” she said.

The man had previously appeared before the courts, but Ardern said “If he had reached the threshold to be in prison, he would have been in prison.”

“By law, we could not keep him in prison. So he was being monitored constantly, as a result of that.”

The attack is the second terror attack in recent New Zealand history. On 15 March 2019, a white supremacist terrorist killed 51 worshippers at a mosque in Christchurch.

Asked about fears of backlash against New Zealand’s Muslim community, Ardern said if that occurred, “It would be absolutely wrong. The community here has been nothing but helpful and supportive, it would be wrong to direct any frustration at anyone beyond this individual. That is who’s culpable, that is who was responsible, no one else.”

Six people were reportedly taken to hospitals around Auckland, three of whom are in critical condition. At least 10 police cars as well as ambulances were at the scene.

Coster said the man had travelled from his home in Glen Eden, to the New Lynn supermarket, as he had done before.

“He was closely watched by surveillance teams and a technical team to monitor his actions and behaviour. He entered the store, as he has done before. He obtained a knife from within the store. Surveillance teams were as close as they possibly could be to monitor his activity. When the commotion started two police tactical operators from the STG moved to his location and engaged him. When he approached them with the knife, he was shot and killed.”

“The reality is that when you are surveilling someone on a 24/7 basis, it is not possible to be immediately next to them at all times, but staff intervened as quickly as they could, and they prevented further injury, in what was a terrifying situation,” he said.

The police acted within 60 seconds of the attack taking place, Coster said.

Footage shared on social media show people screaming and fleeing the Countdown LynnMall supermarket.

A witness called Tim, told Stuff he saw an elderly man lying on the ground with a stab wound to his abdomen. Another victim, a middle-aged woman, was stabbed in the shoulder, he said.

He said: “[People were] running out, hysterically, just screaming, yelling, scared.” “The police came just before I was going to try and find the fella.”

Also speaking to Stuff, Michelle Miller said she was doing her afternoon shop when she saw the attack unfold.

The offender was “running around like a lunatic”, she said. “He was attacking people. All I heard was a lot of screaming.”

She fled the supermarket as police rushed in.

Miller said she heard police ordering the man to give himself up and get on the ground, and said there was a considerable delay before she heard shots fired.

Another witness, Brittany Denyer was about to park when police officers ran up to her and told her to “hurry up and evacuate immediately”.

She said: “People were panicking, and it was a gridlock trying to get out of New Lynn. Police and ambulances [were] everywhere. I was told by another police officer while I was waiting to be diverted that someone had been stabbed.

An Avondale resident Michelle Miller told RNZ: “It’s horrific. I feel sorry for the Countdown staff, I feel sorry for the people who were actually hurt here today. My prayers go out to them. The police have done an amazing job. They had the guy try to give himself up but he wouldn’t. It’s really sad that they had to do what they had to do.”

Miller said she was “pretty shaken up” and that she saw him “running around with a knife, then he just lost the plot”. She did not see anyone injured first hand: “all I heard was a lot of screaming”. Onlookers were “absolutely beside themselves. They can’t believe that this could be so close to home. I haven’t seen anything like this happen before.”

Aanya Diveka was among a group of people who barricaded themselves inside the Lynmall pharmacy after gun shots rang out, RNZ reported.

She had been to get her Covid vaccination and heard screaming.

She said people were panicking and upset. One woman was struggling to breathe. There was no lock on the door so two strong men stood against the door to block it. Eventually, they were escorted out by pharmacy staff out a back exit from the mall.

Countdown Supermarkets said it was devastated by the violent attack.

The general manager of Safety, Kiri Hannifin, said their hearts were heavy, knowing what the team and customers had witnessed.

“Today’s event is particularly distressing, coming so soon after the incident at a store in Dunedin Central, where four people were stabbed in May”, Hannifin said.

Fatal police shootings are relatively rare in New Zealand – averaging at about 3.5 a year, according to a database of the decade from 2007 to 2017. Gun crime is uncommon in New Zealand, especially compared to other parts of the world. But it has been on the rise, despite the government’s clampdown on firearms in the wake of the 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks.

## 113, They Are Us movie script ‘worse than livestream’ of Christchurch attack, say victims’ families

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/13/they-are-us-movie-script-worse-than-livestream-of-christchurch-attack-say-victims-families

> Family members of those killed in the 2019 attack in New Zealand say they have been retraumatised by the script, which has been leaked

The leaked draft script of a controversial film depicting the Christchurch mosque shooting has been described as “worse than the livestream” by those who lost family members in the attack.

The proposed film, They Are Us, which takes its name from prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s comments following the massacre of 51 Muslim worshippers at al Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in 2019, was announced in June. The massacre was livestreamed on Facebook by the gunman.

The film-makers proposed to focus on Ardern’s response in the aftermath of the attack, which immediately drew backlash for centring the story on the leadership of a white woman. Many Muslim New Zealanders criticised the move as “exploitative”, “insensitive”, and “obscene”.

The film’s announcement also triggered an online petition which received nearly 75,000 signatures and compelled the film’s producer, Philippa Campbell, to resign from the project.

The 124-page script, written by New Zealand-born Andrew Niccol, was leaked to Newshub on Sunday.

Earlier this year, Niccol told the Hollywood Reporter that “They Are Us is not so much about the attack but the response to the attack … how an unprecedented act of hate was overcome by an outpouring of love and support.”

Just watched this newshub exclusive on #theyAreUsshutitdown made me sick to my stomach &that's  not even the movie  in itself, it's just wrong on all levels , and this script proves it, it proves it capitlises  over our grief , and the terrorist is on the spotlight. Shut it down. https://t.co/Slxn67kyF8

But Newshub reports that 17 pages of the draft script are devoted to the attack, which would translate to 17 minutes on film, and 15 deaths are described in graphic detail. Newshub also reports that facts about real people have been altered.

Parts of the script show the terrorist in the moments before entering the mosque, accompanied by a “discordant, foreboding sound”.

Further into the script, the writers describe a silhouette of the gunman, and note that it is the “most we will ever see of the gunman. The lack of a clear visual context of the gunman somehow makes the event more shocking, more frightening – mostly what we are left with is the brutality of the sound of unrelenting gunfire”.

Salwa Mohamad, whose husband, Khaled, and son, Hamza Mustafa, were murdered at al Noor mosque, told Newshub that the violence in the film was “worse than the livestream”.

Anjum Rahman, a spokesperson for the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand, added that the leaked draft may be an earlier version of the script, but that the project overall “beggars belief”.

“This is absolutely not about people impacted by the tragedy of this film at all, not in any way.”

Rahman has not read the script but said the depiction of violence she had seen in Newshub’s screenshots was dangerous, especially given that there were copycat attacks planned or carried out after the massacre.

“The livestream is objectionable material in New Zealand. To have it portrayed in graphic detail on the screen like that, I don’t understand what purpose it serves,” Rahman said.

Aya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein was killed in the attack, has not read the script either, but said she was deeply troubled by what she had seen reported.

“It’s just wrong on so many levels. This has affected many people beyond the scope of directly impacted victims. Anyone who has been exposed to the [livestreamed] video is traumatised by it – to see that made into a drama and profited on is wrong on so many levels.”

Al-Umari drew a distinction between a documentary, which sets a higher bar for factual reporting, and a dramatisation that takes creative licence with real experiences.

“How would they feel if it was their brother, sister, mother or father who had been slaughtered and live streamed in this manner and then someone goes and does a movie about it?” she said.

Writer and community advocate Guled Mire said that the script looked to be the opposite of what the film-makers initially proposed, which was to focus on the aftermath of the attack.

“They are literally flipping the script,” he said.

Telling stories of Islamophobia and white supremacy should be reserved for those with lived experience, who can tell those stories with care and delicacy, he said.

Mire said the film-makers were not listening to the community’s concerns, and that Australian actor Rose Byrne, who is slated to play Ardern in the film, should answer the criticism.

“She has yet to answer why she is backing this and she carries a lot of weight.”

The Guardian has approached the film’s studio, FilmNation Entertainment, and Niccol’s agency, CAA, for comment.

## 114, New Zealand's gun buyback website 'a shopping list for criminals'

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/02/new-zealands-gun-buyback-scheme-suspended-after-data-breach

> Police admit that at least one person had been able to access other firearm owners’ personal information online

New Zealand’s high profile gun buyback scheme, enacted by the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, after the Christchurch mosque attacks, has been thrown into disarray after police admitted that at least one person had been able to access other firearm owners’ personal information online.

The error became public on Monday when a gun lobby group said it had spoken to 15 people who were able to access information on a website where firearms owners registered weapons to be relinquished. It included their names, addresses, dates of birth, firearms licence numbers and bank account details, the group said.

“It’s a shopping list for criminals,” said Nicole McKee, from the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners. She added that gun owners who had not turned in their weapons were “now being told they have to comply with a system that cannot be trusted”.

The website was shut down on Monday morning and would not be used until the police could guarantee the safety of information, officers said.

Ardern won global praise when she announced six days after a gunman stormed two mosques in Christchurch, killing 51 Muslim worshippers, that the government would ban all the weapons used in the attacks. Less than a month later, a law prohibiting ownership of most semiautomatic weapons passed New Zealand’s parliament by 119 votes to one.

Since the law change, New Zealand’s police have operated a buyback and amnesty scheme for now illegal weapons, magazines and parts which was due to finish in less than three weeks, on 20 December, at which point owners would be prosecuted for possessing them.

On Monday New Zealand’s deputy police commissioner, Mike Clement, said an update on the buyback scheme’s website last week had caused personal information to be revealed more widely than it should have been. He blamed the software provider, the German company SAP, for what he called “human error”.

The site was custom-built for the gun buyback.

Clement said officers knew of only one person, a gun dealer, who had received access to the information. Gun dealers have been permitted to act as collection agents for the buyback scheme for weapons owners who did not want to attend public events run by the police.

But Clement said the dealer should not have been able to view so much detail, and the software update was “not authorised” by the police. The person who had accessed it had done nothing wrong, he said.

“This is a timely reminder to us all that we have to be particularly secure with people’s personal information,” he said, adding that the police had not done anything wrong either.

SAP was “working through their audit logs” to find out what information had been accessed. Clement said sharing personal information accessed through the site would be illegal.

“We’re pretty disappointed about this,” the police minister, Stuart Nash, said. He would wait until he learned more about what had happened before he commented on whether anyone should be censured.

Nash said the buyback had so far collected 43,000 weapons, most of them being “the type of firearms that are used to kill people”.

A second tranche of gun reforms before parliament would introduce a guns register – New Zealand issues permits to firearms owners rather than their weapons – and strengthen police powers to prevent certain people from gaining licences.

McKee defended the group’s decision to make the breach public, saying the revelations showed the buyback process had been “rushed”. Her organisation had published screenshots of what the person had accessed, with identifying details removed.

“We thought that it was imperative that we get the information out to the 38,000 people that their information had been compromised,” she said. “That has to outweigh the possibility of getting more firearms in.”

Clement could not “offer an absolute iron-clad guarantee” that private information had not been misused, but he would investigate what had happened.



## 115, New Zealand: Ardern flags further gun control reforms after firearms charges peak 

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/15/new-zealand-ardern-flags-further-gun-control-reforms-after-firearms-charges-peak

> Prime minister says 2020 police statistics have only reinforced government’s commitment to crackdown 

An increase in charges over gun crime in New Zealand – despite sweeping reforms introduced after the Christchurch mosque attacks in 2019 – has shown the need for further restrictions, the government and campaigners agree.

The deaths of 51 people at al-Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic centre two years ago led to a sweeping ban on a range of semi-automatic rifles and large ammunition magazines and a gun buy-back scheme, which removed about 60,000 guns from circulation.

But Radio New Zealand reported on Monday that the reform “has had no impact on a rise in gun crime and violence”, pointing to police statistics that show charges reached a new peak in 2020. Nearly 2,400 people were charged with 4,542 firearms-related offences, nearly double that of a decade earlier, while 1,862 firearms were seized under the Search and Surveillance Act, compared with 860 10 years ago.

Nicole McKee of the Act party, which strongly opposed the gun law reforms, told RNZ the legislation had been rushed through and “the unintended consequences … are starting to be realised”.

But Gun Control NZ co-founder Philippa Yasbek, an economist and public health advocate, said the increase in charges reflected police taking gun crime more seriously. “Police are charging firearms offences at a much higher rate than they previously were, which we think is really positive,” she said.

“Opponents of gun control suggest that if a single, narrow gun restriction doesn’t show an immediate drop in all gun crime, then it’s a failure,” said Philip Alpers, an Australia-based expert in gun laws and director of GunPolicy.org. “… Sadly, New Zealand police lost control of guns when they stopped registering 96% of firearms. Now it’s those most common, unpoliced firearms which almost invariably turn up in day-to-day gun crime.”

Gang culture is reported to be on the rise in New Zealand, with police figures showing a 13% increase in recruits last year on 2019 – which has been linked to the arrival of gang members from Australia under the controversial 501 deportation policy.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on RNZ’s Morning Report programme that these new statistics only reinforced the government’s commitment to further firearms reform as well as a crackdown on organised crime. “We do have an increasing issue with gun use, particularly amongst our organised criminals so, for me, that is more rationale for the kinds of legislation we already put in place.”

Police had told her that “guns were increasingly present”, Ardern said. “We have removed a particular form of weapon from circulation. But that does not mean of course that there are not still weapons in use by gangs, or that they are not available. … These are things that are going to take some time to turn around.”

Yasbek told the Guardian that the New Zealand government’s steps towards gun control were positive but needed to go further, with cross-party backing. “Our new firearms laws, while modelled on the Australian ones, are nowhere near as strict – we think our laws should be brought closer.”

In particular Gun Control NZ is pushing for the national firearms register – promised as part of the second round of reforms, which are yet to be implemented – to be established more quickly. Under the current timeline the register is expected to take 10 years to be fully populated.

Gun Control also wants to restrict sales of ammunition to registered firearms; for licenses to be renewed every five years, not every 10 years; and some exemptions removed.

Yasbek said the government seemed “reasonably committed” to gun control, but there was a possibility that reforms could be watered down by political opposition. “The prime minister put quite a lot of her personal capital on the line with the law change … Ultimately this needs to be about all sides of the political spectrum, and I think that’s what made the reforms so durable in Australia.”

## 116, New Zealand telco bans 8chan as chief censor calls it racist killers' 'platform of choice'

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/09/new-zealand-telco-bans-8chan-as-chief-censor-calls-it-racist-killers-platform-of-choice

> Major telecoms company bans access to far-right site in wake of El Paso shooting manifesto that praised Christchurch attack

One of New Zealand’s largest telecommunications providers, Spark, has banned the far-right site 8chan after the country’s chief censor offered his backing for any internet service provider who did so in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting.

Censor David Shanks applauded Spark’s “brave and meaningful” decision, describing the message board as “the white supremacist killer’s platform of choice”.

“These are extraordinary circumstances, and platforms that promote terrorist atrocities should not be tolerated on the internet, or anywhere else. Spark is making the right call here.” he said.

In announcing its decision, Spark said the platform was guilty of “repeated transgressions” and hosted “disturbing material”.

8chan – on which the El Paso suspect reportedly published his screed – has been temporarily forced offline while it looks for another host. Spark said that if the website became active again its customers in New Zealand would not be able to access it.

The El Paso document included expressions of support for the Christchurch gunman, whose livestreamed attack on worshippers in New Zealand in March left 51 people dead.

Spark’s move apparently came after Shanks said he would support any ISP that decided to ban 8chan. It said in a statement: “We’ve taken a consistent view that the appropriate agencies of government should put in place a robust policy framework to address the important issues surrounding such material being distributed online and freely available.

“As an internet service provider, we don’t make these decisions lightly and want to work with Government, the wider industry and civil society organisations to make the internet a better place for New Zealanders.”

Spark confirmed 8Chan was the only website it will block.

Shanks said he was aware that ISPs “do not want to be in the business of making judgments around the content of sites”.

“This is a unique set of circumstances, and relying on ISPs to make these calls is not a solution for the mid or long term. I agree with calls for a transparent, robust and sensible regulatory response. Discussions have already started on what this might look like here in NZ. Ultimately this is a global, internet problem.”

Following the mosque attacks in March, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has led a global effort to pressure internet providers and social media companies to eliminate terrorist and violent content online.

Known as the “Christchurch call”, Ardern said no one had a right to livestream mass murder. “We want to maintain the principles of a free, open and secure internet, but this isn’t about freedom of expression, this is about preventing violent extremism and terrorism online. I don’t think anyone would argue that the terrorist on the 15th of March had a right to livestream the murder of 50 people,” she said.

“We all need to act, and that includes social media providers taking more responsibility for the content that is on their platforms … it’s critical that technology platforms like Facebook are not perverted as a tool for terrorism, and instead become part of a global solution to countering extremism.”

According to geopolitical and strategic risk expert Paul Buchanan, users of 8chan commented on the Christchurch live feed, urging the killer on and applauding his efforts.

“8chan has become a hate fest and incites violence. I was monitoring 8chan as he was killing people in the mosque. They were cheering for him, they were saying that he should shoot people twice. It was horrifying,” said Buchanan.

“if you can read English, no matter where you are in the world, you can go to 8chan and have your white supremacist extremist views confirmed … how to make bombs, how to avoid surveillance. It’s full-on insurgent and guerrilla preparation.”

Following the Christchurch attack, Australian internet providers temporarily blocked access to sites hosting the shooter’s video of the massacre, including 8chan and 4chan.

However following the El Paso shooting, Australia’s version of the chief censor said websites carrying the manifesto did not reach the benchmark for censorship.

“When issuing such a direction, the esafety commissioner assesses whether the crisis event involves terrorist or extreme violent material being disseminated online in a manner likely to cause significant harm to the Australian community,” a spokesperson for Australia’s esafety commissioner told the Guardian.

“While the attack in El Paso was a heinous act of terror, in exercising our discretion we have determined the manifesto does not reach this threshold.”

## 117, Scott Morrison attacks 'mindless tribalism' after Christchurch massacre

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/18/scott-morrison-attacks-mindless-tribalism-after-christchurch-massacre

> Australian prime minister’s speech came hours after Peter Dutton’s criticism of Muslim senator Mehreen Faruqi 

Scott Morrison has called on Australians to “disagree better” just hours after Peter Dutton accused Greens politicians of being just as bad as the disgraced far-right senator Fraser Anning.

In a speech to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce in Victoria, the prime minister also said he wanted the nation to “reject the thinking that one person’s gain is another’s loss”.

Earlier this month, the prime minister said it was “simple math” that medically transferred asylum seekers would take the place of Australian citizen patients in hospitals. He had spoken up in support of Dutton after his home affairs minister had made similar claims.

On Monday, Morrison said he wanted to “remove the demarcation lines between Australians”.

“I want us to reject the thinking that one person’s gain is another’s loss,” he said. “This is a doctrine of scarcity that betrays our social and economic prosperity and creates an environment for conflict and division.

“I see every Australian as an individual, not part of some tribal group to be traded off against another.”

While denouncing racism and “tribalism”, Morrison also said the community needed to be free to hold “legitimate policy debates” on issues such as migrant intake and border security without the conversations being “hijacked” by accusations of intolerance or racial hatred.

Morrison said he would be visiting the governor general in the coming weeks to call for an election, and ask Australians not to “join my side but to convince them … we are on theirs”.

The Christchurch terrorist attack dominated Morrison’s speech, with the prime minister saying he wanted to engage in a “broader reflection” on “how we see difference in our world and how we manage it”.

“The bonds between us all matter,” he told the audience in Melbourne. “The rainforests in north Queensland are older than the Amazon. Every part of this ecosystem reinforces itself. It doesn’t grow apart, it grows together.

“And so it is with countries and their peoples. But these ties that bind us are under new pressures and are at risk of breaking.

“If we allow a culture of ‘us and them’, of tribalism, to take hold; if we surrender an individual to be defined not by their own unique worth and contribution but by the tribe they are assigned to; if we yield to the compulsion to pick sides rather than happy coexistence, we will lose what makes diversity work in Australia.”

Morrison attacked “tribalism”, which he said was increasingly “taking over”, with people only reading the news they agreed with, interacting with people they agreed with and “having less understanding and grace towards others that we do not even know, making the worst possible assumptions about them and their motives, simply because we disagree with them”.

His words came hours after Dutton attacked the Muslim senator Mehreen Faruqi and the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, for their criticisms of his rhetoric in regards to African “gangs”, asylum seekers and refugees in recent years.

“I’m hardly going to take morals lectures from the extreme left, who frankly are just as bad in this circumstance as people like Fraser Anning – they should equally be condemned,” Dutton told ABC radio on Monday.

In his speech, Morrison said tribalism was true of “the left and the right”.

“And even more so from those shouting from the fringes to a mainstream of quiet Australians that just want to get on with their lives,” he said. “Hate, blame and contempt are the staples of tribalism. It is consuming modern debate, egged on by an appetite for conflict as entertainment, not so different from the primitive appetites of the Colosseum days, with a similar corrosive impact on the fabric of our society.

“Contempt is defined by the philosophers as ‘the unsullied conviction of the worthlessness of another’. The worthlessness of another! That is where mindless tribalism takes us.

“It ends in the worst of places. Last week it ended the lives of 50 fellow human beings, including children praying in Christchurch.”

Morrison said the discussion around immigration intake was a “classic example” of tribalism at work and said “frustrations” about traffic and infrastructure did not mean people were “anti-migrant or racist”.

“For the overwhelming majority of Australians concerned about this issue, this is not and never would be their motivation. But that is how the tribalists seek to confect it, from both sides.

“The worst example being the despicable appropriation of concerns about immigration as a justification for a terrorist atrocity. Such views have rightly been denounced. But equally, so too must the imputation that the motivation for supporting moderated immigration levels is racial hatred.

“We cannot allow such legitimate policy debates to be hijacked like this.”

Morrison praised the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, for her words after Christchurch attack on Friday, when she said of the country’s Muslim community “they are us”.

“This is a powerful idea. No them but us … As prime minister, I want to continue to bring Australians together, not set them against one another.”

Morrison also announced a further $55m in community safety grants, with priority to be given to religious schools and places of worship and religious assembly, following the Christchurch attack. The money is to help community and religious groups upgrade security at their facilities.

## 118, Trump showed interest in New Zealand gun buyback program, Ardern says

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/23/donald-trump-jacinda-ardern-gun-buyback-un

> Prime minister says she and Trump discussed her country’s reforms on sidelines of UN general assembly

Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand prime minister, has said Donald Trump expressed “interest” in her country’s gun buyback program, as the US president faces calls for dramatic changes to the nation’s firearms laws.

After the two leaders met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Ardern told reporters that she “sensed an interest” from the US president in the sweeping gun reforms her government passed after the Christchurch mosque shootings in March.

“It was a conversation around our buyback and obviously the work that we have done to remove military-style semi-automatics weapons and assault rifles,” Ardern said.

“We had a conversation around what had happened in New Zealand, how it worked, and I referenced the fact that actually Australia had gone through a similar process and we really learned from them. It was really just sharing our experience, which obviously is pretty unique.”

New Zealand earned international praise for its swift response to the Christchurch massacre, in which a lone gunman killed 51 people and injured dozens more at two mosques in the city.

Days after the shooting, Ardern announced that most semi-automatic weapons would be banned. Weeks later, the country’s parliament overwhelmingly passed a law outlawing certain semi-automatics and compelling owners of such weapons to hand them over as part of the nation’s gun buyback program. So far, owners have returned as many as 15,000 banned firearms.

By contrast, a summer of carnage in the US – punctuated by mass shootings in El Paso, Texas; Midland and Odessa, Texas; and Dayton, Ohio – has prompted calls for sweeping gun reforms but so far no action by its politicians.

Gun buyback programs have always been controversial in the US, even among Democrats who near uniformly support strengthening the nation’s gun laws. But the Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke has shifted the debate with his vow to take away the millions of AR-15 and AK-47 rifles in possession.

Trump has at times expressed support for expanding background checks for firearm purchases – only to walk it back under pressure from Republicans and the National Rifle Association.

Gun control was only a part of what Ardern described as a “wide-ranging” conversation with the US president, which also touched on trade, tourism and national security.

A readout from the White House press secretary, Hogan Gidley, made no mention of their discussion about the gun buyback program.

“The two leaders discussed a variety of bilateral issues, including the United States steadfast support for New Zealand after the Christchurch attack,” according to the readout. “The president expressed continued support for the sentiment behind the Christchurch Call to Action and vowed to continue partnering with New Zealand to counter online violent extremism.”

In May, Ardern convened the Christchurch Call to Action summit in Paris, where she and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, convened world leaders and global tech giants in an attempt to strengthen efforts to combat online extremism. At its conclusion, the leaders and tech companies signed a pledge to “eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online”. The US declined to attend and is not a signatory of the pledge.

There was also some dispute between the countries about what to call their meeting. Trump’s public schedule labeled it a “pull aside” while Ardern referred to it as a “bilateral”. Trump’s one-on-ones with the presidents of Pakistan, Poland, Egypt and Singapore were described as “bilateral meetings”.

After the meeting, Ardern downplayed the discrepancy, and noted that the two leaders had spoken for roughly 25 minutes and that Trump’s “warmth and high regard” for New Zealanders shone through in their conversation.

She added that he had a “good knowledge and understanding” of the country and some of the “big personalities that have come out of New Zealand”.

Pressed for details on who Trump had mentioned, Ardern divulged only one name: the left-handed golfing legend Bob Charles.

## 120, 'We're having a bit of an earthquake – we're fine.' Is Jacinda Ardern unshakeable?

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/jacinda-ardern-earthquake-new-zealand-pandemic-cool-calm

> The New Zealand prime minister has calmly steered her country in the face of a massacre, an eruption, and a pandemic. Now she is laughing in the face of seismic shakes 

Name: Jacinda Ardern v the earthquake.

Age: New Zealand prime minister Ardern is 39; the earthquake was on Monday morning.Appearance: Wobbly.Jacinda? No, she was cool, calm and smiling throughout. It was everything around her that was shaking as the 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck during a live interview she was giving to a breakfast TV station from a room in the New Zealand parliament building in Wellington. “We’re just having a bit of an earthquake here … we’re fine,” she told interviewer Ryan Bridge.What a hero! I wonder how Boris Johnson would have reacted. He would probably have dived under the lectern or maybe hidden behind deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries.Ardern is having quite a time in office. You can say that again. As journalist Michael Field put it: “What’s an earthquake when, as prime minister, you’ve dealt with a massacre, an eruption and a pandemic.” She survived them all. More than that, she brought the nation together at a time of fear and adversity. She responded quickly to the Christchurch mosque shootings in March 2019, embraced the Muslim community, and immediately banned semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles. She showed the same empathy after the White Island eruption in December 2019 and her policy of locking down early in response to the coronavirus pandemic made New Zealand a model for best practice.Amazing. Indeed. She also became the second world leader ever to give birth while in office when she welcomed daughter Neve Te Aroha in June 2018.She seems too good to be true. Maybe our expectations have been lowered by the quality of leaders elsewhere in the world.There must be something bad about her we can dig up. The Financial Times doesn’t think so, headlining an article that praised her attention to detail in the handling of the coronavirus crisis “Arise Saint Jacinda, a leader for our troubled times”. But there are some who say the lockdown has been over the top and devastated the New Zealand economy unnecessarily. “We don’t want to squash a flea with a sledgehammer and bring the house down,” said one Auckland-based epidemiologist. How has she responded to the criticism? She took a 20% pay cut to show solidarity with her country’s suffering workers, and is now floating the controversial idea of a four-day working week in a bid to boost domestic tourism.How are her poll ratings? Stratospheric. Off the political Richter scale. Her personal approval rating is 65% while the opposition leader is on 7%. 

Do say: “Any chance she could run the UK as well?”Don’t say: “A baby is no big deal for a politician. Boris has produced six. At least!”

## 121, New Zealand stabbings: officials tried for years to deport terrorist prior to Auckland attack, Jacinda Ardern says

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/05/new-zealand-stabbings-officials-tried-for-years-to-deport-terrorist-prior-to-auckland-attack-jacinda-adern-says

> Jacinda Ardern says ‘every legal avenue’ was used to detain Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen until his refugee status was resolved

New Zealand had tried for years to deport the terrorist who stabbed shoppers in an Auckland supermarket on Friday before being shot dead by the police officers tasked with watching him, the country’s prime minister has said.

Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen, a 32-year-old Sri Lankan man, was fighting to keep his refugee status in New Zealand when he carried out the attack, which Jacinda Ardern said was inspired by the Islamic State.

Neither his name nor the fact that he was a refugee could be reported until a suppression order by a New Zealand judge was lifted late on Saturday night. The identity of refugees, and their immigration status, are automatically protected by law in New Zealand.

Officials had tried to justify detaining Samsudeen in jail until his asylum case was resolved but there were no legal grounds for doing so. Instead, 30 officers watched him around the clock for more than 50 days before he grabbed a knife from a supermarket shelf and attacked shoppers, metres away from the undercover police surveilling him.

Seven people were hurt in the attack, five of them with stab wounds. Three of those injured were in a critical condition in hospital on Saturday.

The attack rattled New Zealand, which until Friday had not experienced an Islamic State-inspired act of terror, with the nation’s grief echoing the aftermath of the 2019 terrorist attacks on two Christchurch mosques, when 51 worshiping Muslims were murdered by a white supremacist from Australia.

Friday’s attack provoked fresh debate about a proposed law change currently before parliament that would make the act of planning a terrorist attack a crime – a legal gap identified after the Christchurch shooting.

Samsudeen arrived in New Zealand in October 2011, aged 22, on a student visa. Shortly after arriving he made a claim for refugee status. Immigration New Zealand declined this claim in 2012, but he appealed to the Immigration and Protection Tribunal and was successful. He was granted refugee status in December 2013.

In 2016 he caught the attention of the police and the Security Intelligence Service after talking sympathetically on Facebook about terrorist attacks, violent war-related videos and comments advocating violence extremism, and he was spoken to by police.

In May 2017, Samsudeen was arrested at Auckland International airport. Police believed he was heading to Syria, and a search of his apartment found Islamic State propaganda, and a hunting knife. He was released on bail, but in August 2018 – while on bail - bought a knife and police arrested him again, and found further extremist material.

Authorities had known Samsudeen wanted to commit a terrorist attack, but planning one is not a crime in New Zealand. Ardern said her government had asked the passage of a controversial new antiterrorism law to be sped up on the same day Friday’s mass stabbing took place, and she hoped it will pass by the end of the month.

By 2020, he had already been detained for three years. He was found guilty of the charges for IS propaganda, and sentenced in July 2021 to a year’s supervision, with a series of conditions that restricted him from internet devices.

Back in February 2019, Samsudeen’s refugee status was cancelled and he was served with deportation liability notices. Ardern added that his refugee claim had been based on a fraudulent document, although she did not elaborate further. He appealed against his deportation to the Immigration and Protection Tribunal. He was still in prison at this time, and facing criminal charges. The deportation appeal could not proceed until after the conclusion of the criminal trial in May 2021

“In the meantime, agencies were concerned about the risk this individual posed to the community. They also knew he may be released from prison, and that his appeal through the tribunal, which was stopping his deportation, may take some time,” Ardern said.

“Immigration New Zealand explored whether the Immigration Act might allow them to detain the individual while his deportation appeal was heard. It was incredibly disappointing and frustrating when legal advice came back to say this wasn’t an option.”

A person can only be detained under the Immigration Act for the purpose of deportation. Immigration New Zealand was required to consider whether deportation was likely to proceed but crown law’s advice was that the individual was likely to be considered a “protected person” because of the status of the country from which he had travelled, and likely treatment on return. Samsudeen and his family have said that he was harassed for his politics and tortured in Sri Lanka before he came to New Zealand.

Protected people cannot be deported from New Zealand. After receiving this advice, Immigration New Zealand determined it could not detain the individual while he waited for his appeal.

“Soon after, he was released from prison, and police began their monitoring and surveillance of him. On the 26 August, the Immigration and Protection Tribunal hearing was rescheduled. At the time of the terrorist attack, the offenders attempt to overturn the deportation decision was still ongoing.

“This has been a frustrating process,” Ardern said.

“Since 2018 ministers have been seeking advice on our ability to deport this individual. In July this year, I met with officials in person and expressed my concern that the law could allow someone to remain here who obtained their immigration status fraudulently and posed a threat to our national security.”

Ardern said she asked officials whether the law should be amended.

“Ultimately these timelines show that Immigration New Zealand from the beginning have sought to deport this individual, and were right to do so.” Jacinda Ardern said.

“Agencies used every tool available to protect innocent people from this individual,” Ardern said. “Every legal avenue was tried.”

But some of those who had suggested rehabilitation strategies for Samsudeen said there were questions for the government and officials to answer about how the terrorist’s mental health conditions were addressed, and what deradicalisation work had been undertaken with him.

One analyst produced a report about Samsudeen for a court hearing in 2018 that assessed him as being of low harm if he was engaged in an adequate deradicalisation process. Such rehabilitation was ordered by the judge, but the analyst, Clarke Jones, told the Guardian it was not immediately clear whether any was carried out.

“The Australian and now New Zealand governments prefer to go on this securitised approach,” Jones said, referring to the decision to tail the terrorist and attempts to force him out of the country.

Referring to rehabilitation programmes when he said had worked well overseas, Jones said: “There’s no guarantees in any intervention to stop someone going down the pathway of crime or violent extremism but we would have had a much better chance.”

Advocates for Samsudeen suggested a programme for him in cooperation with Auckland’s Muslim community, Jones said. The Sri Lankan man did not fit the profile of young, radicalised ideologues and did not have a political agenda, Jones added.

Jones said New Zealand’s deradicalisation approach was still immature, and that work could not be left solely to religious leaders, especially for those, like Samsudeen, who had serious mental health conditions.

The terrorist’s brother echoed the concerns about his mental health in a statement provided to the Guardian by one of Samsudeen’s lawyers.

“Aathil always contradicted what he was told. He would hang up the phone on us when we told him to forget about all of the issues he was obsessed with. Then he would call us back again himself when he realised he was wrong,” wrote Aroos, the brother, in a statement that characterised Samsudeen’s mental health as deteriorating over a decade. “Aathil was wrong again yesterday. Of course we feel very sad that he could not be saved.”

The family was “ready to help you all in the healing process no matter what it is needed from us”, Aroos added.

Ardern earlier said Samsudeen had refused a psychiatric assessment that could have seen him forced into a mental health facility.

There appeared to be nothing out of the ordinary when Samsudeen left his house to buy groceries at a supermarket in a west Auckland mall on Friday, said Andrew Coster, New Zealand’s police commissioner. Officers tailing him – who had waited at the entrance to the supermarket – had not realised until 60-90 seconds into the attack that he was stabbing shoppers.

Samsudeen was “highly paranoid”, took counter-surveillance measures, and had on other occasions accused members of the public of tailing him, Coster said.

Although court documents about the man were released on Saturday night, after a hastily convened hearing hours after the attack, Ardern said she would not speak the terrorist’s name, a policy she implemented after the Christchurch attacks for fear of giving the killer notoriety.

“No terrorist alive or deceased deserves a name to be shared for the infamy they were seeking,” she said.

## 122, Jacinda Ardern prevails in final debate before New Zealand election

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/15/jacinda-ardern-prevails-in-final-debate-ahead-of-new-zealand-election

> Leader says she will resign if not re-elected but polls show Labour 15 points ahead

Jacinda Ardern has dominated the final leaders’ debate before New Zealand goes to the polls on Saturday, appearing confident and prime ministerial as she took on a subdued Judith Collins.

In a surprise admission, Ardern said if she was not re-elected, she would resign as Labour leader.

In a Colmar Brunton poll released an hour before the debate, Labour was polling 15 points ahead of the opposition National party, with Ardern as the preferred prime minister.

The poll also showed the Green party at 8%, meaning it would be in a position to form a coalition government with Labour and put forward one of its own MPs for deputy prime minister – either James Shaw or Marama Davidson.

Collins has had a difficult week on the campaign trail and has drawn criticism for controversial comments, including saying obese people should take more personal responsibility for their weight.

In contrast, Ardern has drawn adoring crowds. Asked by the moderator, Jessica Mutch-McKay, whether her government had been “transformational” Ardern said it had but that she needed more time to shake up the status quo and repair decades of neglect in housing, transport and the environment.

During a lengthy discussion, both Ardern and Collins said they would commit to halving child poverty by 2030. New Zealand has one of the worst rates of child poverty and infant mortality in the developed world.

Ardern said her government had made gains on entrenched poverty by raising benefits for the most deprived, expanding its school lunch programmes and raising the minimum wage.

Asked what made them stand out as leaders, Collins and Ardern gave markedly different answers.

Ardern replied: “We are in this job by privilege and not a right. I never take this job for granted; you can always be assured I will give my everything.”

Collins cited her 20 years as a lawyer, her business acumen and her experience leading companies.

Collins accused Ardern’s government of repeatedly breaking promises to voters, including pledges to reduce child poverty and build 100,000 affordable homes.

This claim riled Ardern, who said she was not a liar and objected to being labelled one, slamming Collins for causing “mischief” and spreading “misinformation”.

The Green party has said it would insist on implementing a wealth tax with whomever it formed a coalition. Both leaders, however, ruled out agreeing to a wealth tax.

On the climate emergency, Ardern said the issue should be framed as “an opportunity” rather than a crisis. Collins, however, said farmers were being scapegoated and blamed for climate breakdown when other, larger nations, should shoulder more of the responsibility.

Mutch-McKay said it was unusual to have an election with two female leaders, and Ardern said it was important that parliament was representative of New Zealand, including Māori, women and Pasifika people.

Collins said that while she wanted women in leadership roles, she thought people should be promoted on merit.

Asked if they had anything to say to each other, Ardern thanked Collins for her “moving and sincere” speech after the Christchurch mosque shootings in March last year, and her action on gun control.

Collins thanked Ardern for giving “her heart and soul” to the job of prime minister, and said she knew the effort, time and toll it could take. Collins admitted that while she enjoyed the campaign trail, she missed having dinner with her husband and son.

Ardern said whether or not she stayed in politics after the election, she wanted to reform politics to stop the mudslinging and elitism.

Political commentators say Ardern’s competent handling of the Covid-19 crisis has earned her the trust of New Zealanders, many of whom do not want a change of leadership with so much uncertainty already brought by the pandemic.

New Zealand operates under the mixed member proportional electoral system, which is designed to install coalition governments. But for the first time since the system was introduced in 1996, Labour may get the numbers on Saturday to govern alone.

## 123, Here be trolls: New Zealand’s female politicians battle rising tide of misogyny

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/here-be-trolls-new-zealands-female-politicians-battle-rising-tide-of-misogyny

> Led by Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand women are entering uncharted territory in politics – and encountering increasing levels of abuse

In January 2020, a New Zealand man sent two emails to prime minister Jacinda Ardern: one threatening to “personally wipe [her] off this fucking planet” and another saying he would blow her head off. It was the violent culmination of 88 lengthy emails sent over a four month period to government officials in which he referred to them as criminals and terrorists.

Last week, the man, Michael Cruickshank, 56, was unapologetic as he was sentenced to one year in prison for threatening to kill the prime minister.

Judge Gibson denied the defence’s request for home detention, on the basis that public officials were very much at risk of threats to their lives and the court must act accordingly. The offence “strikes at the roots of our democracy”, he said.

The public officials who are being targeted more than most, and in increasingly more violent and alarming ways, are women in politics.

The current parliament is the most diverse in New Zealand’s history, with its highest representation of women. There are now 58 female MPs, making up 48% of elected members – 12 more than in 2017, when Ardern first took office. Three out of the five parties voted in are either led, or co-led, by women.

Ardern has ticked off a few firsts for women in politics – she is the first New Zealand prime minister to give birth while in office, and the second in the world, and under her leadership Nanaia Mahuta became the country’s first female minister of foreign affairs.

But as women forge their way across uncharted territory in politics, and become more visible, an old warning with a modern twist emerges: here be trolls.

Female MPs are battling a constantly rising tide of misogynistic abuse – from rape and death threats, to derogatory comments about appearances and questioning of their qualifications – much of which is being spewed out online by people hiding behind anonymous social media accounts.

There has been an exponential growth in this type of abuse, says Kate Hannah, a project lead on The Disinformation Project, which maps online misinformation, disinformation and the spread of dangerous and hateful comments. “We can definitively say … that between the period of, say August to November last year, the level of misogynistic targeting of women in the public eye, including MPs, increased almost day on day.”

The content of the abuse is rooted in traditional and conservative views of women’s role in society and classic misogyny, with frequent references to motherhood, witchcraft and sexual behaviour. The tone is becoming “more vulgar and heightened,” Hannah says.

Misogyny is not just about hatred of women, it is about the control and punishment of women who are challenging male dominance, Hannah says. When you have a government, with highly visible, powerful women, those feeling challenged start to get upset. “There is a lot of stuff about objectifying and controlling and keeping women ‘in their place’,” she says.

The abuse extends to relatively low-profile public servants too, Hannah says, who may not have the same level of security.

“I am personally, and professionally, fearful we will have our own Jo Cox moment,” she says, referring to the British MP who was shot and stabbed to death by a far-right terrorist in 2016.

The police say they take threats of abuse seriously and will investigate matters where appropriate.

But Hannah says the regulatory framework for protecting people against online threats is both murky and poor, adding that there needs to be a “one-stop-shop” where someone can report abuse and action is taken either with the social media platform or via police.

“There is a real deep-rooted sense of hatred,” says Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, the co-leader of Te Pati Māori (the Māori party).

Since Ngarewa-Packer entered parliament in 2020, the threats against her have escalated, and are also nasty in their anti-Māori specificity, calling for her to experience the horrors – including rape and murder – her ancestors went through at the hands of colonisers.

“It can really be quite soul destroying, because the things I was raised to be proud of are the things that make the attackers most uncomfortable.”

Recently, Ngarewa-Packer’s husband has been attacked and someone has scaled her apartment building, while threats come from both anonymous and identifiable people in voicemails, emails and social media comments.

The threats become more pronounced whenever anything to do with Māori policy arises, regardless of whether it is a policy supported by her party, she says.

“I would not be surprised if young Māori women who are very proud of their identity don’t step up because that [hatred] is so deep rooted.”

An MP from the right-wing ACT Party, Karen Chhour, who is also Māori, says the harassment levelled at her is more personal than political compared with her male colleagues. She accepts that part of having a public role is facing criticism but abuse threatens the accessibility New Zealanders have to politicians.

“That’s what makes our country so special – politicians are accessible – and I would hate to see that change.”

While the abuse often comes from the public, the flames can be fanned within parliament’s halls and by those associated with political parties.

Last week, news website Stuff reported on a campaign of misogynistic online bullying against left-wing female politicians Megan Woods, the housing minister, Labour MP Sarah Pallett and Christchurch city councillor Sara Templeton. The abuse came from a fake social media account and was eventually linked to a member of the youth wing of the National Party – the Young Nats – who has since left the group.

Centre-right National Party MP Nicola Willis condemned the behaviour and acknowledged Templeton for notifying police.

“What that has done has reminded a lot of people – keyboard warriors, anonymous people – that in fact they are not anonymous. When they harass people they can be found out.”

Willis said she hasn’t experienced the same level of abuse as some other women, but she regularly faces misogynistic comments and people “seeking to silence” her.

“I find that reprehensible because the message that sends is: if you’re a woman in politics, don’t be too feisty, don’t be too loud … because then someone might attack you for it.”

Left-wing Green Party MP Golriz Ghahraman, the country’s first refugee member of parliament, experienced an onslaught of abuse from the moment she entered politics. “It became very violent, very quickly.”

In her 2017 maiden speech to parliament – 18 months before the Christchurch mosque attacks – she highlighted the prevalence of racism in New Zealand and referenced comments on her social media threads that said it was “time to load our shotguns”.

In 2019 she was assigned a security escort following a series of death threats – abuse that she believes escalated after comments from other politicians.

“When we play communities, rather than issues, when we debate immigration in a xenophobic way … there are communities out there that you’re making unsafe,” she said of politicians who rely on these tactics.

The people copping the most abuse in parliament – women, Māori, and people of colour – are the same groups being abused within the community, or watching abuse towards politicians play out online, Ghahraman says.

“There’s this threat of making politics less accessible and less diverse if we act like it’s just a given that women who make themselves visible are going to get this kind of threat.”

## 124, Jacinda Ardern suggests opposition leader Judith Collins is a ‘Karen’

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/01/new-zealand-jacinda-ardern-opposition-judith-collins-leader-karen

> Comments by New Zealand PM came during a parliamentary debate on the country’s new hate speech laws

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has suggested her opposition party counterpart could be called a “Karen” during a fierce debate in parliament over laws governing hate speech.

Judith Collins, the leader of the opposition, has argued strongly against changes to the country’s hate speech laws, saying the new rules could mean “people feeling insulted being able to criminalise people who make them feel insulted.” After the 15 March mosque attacks by a white supremacist, the New Zealand government has proposed introducing much harsher penalties for those who incite or “normalise” discrimination or hatred.

Ardern said she disagreed with “the member’s [Collins’] statement on Twitter that somehow it will become illegal to call someone a ‘Karen’.”

“That is absolutely incorrect, and I apologise – that means these laws will not protect that member [Collins] from such a claim.”

“Karen” is a term that evolved on social media, describing a middle-class white woman who behaves in an entitled, pushy, demanding and privileged manner.

New Zealand’s parliament is a kind of elephant’s graveyard of internet memes. In late 2019, Green MP Chlöe Swarbrick went viral for dropping a casual “OK boomer” in response to being heckled during her speech in a sitting of the New Zealand parliament.

Collins stood to raise a point of order in response to Ardern, Stuff reported – but no comeback was forthcoming.

## 125, Conviction overturned for man who sent death threats to Jacinda Ardern

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/19/conviction-overturned-for-man-who-sent-death-threats-to-jacinda-ardern

> Michael Cruickshank argued he was so drunk he could not remember sending the threats to New Zealand’s prime minister 

A man sent to prison for sending death threats to New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has had his conviction overturned.

Michael Cruickshank was sentenced to 12 months in prison in March, for a series of emails in which he made violent threats against Ardern. He argued that he was so drunk he could not remember sending the threats, had no intention of seeing them through, and didn’t intend the recipients to take them seriously. On Wednesday, the court of appeal judged that there had been a miscarriage of justice in the case.

The overturning of his charges hinged on his alleged drunkenness, and whether it had been made clear to the jury that Cruickshank’s intoxication was relevant to his defence. Cruickshank said in police interviews: “To be perfectly frank I do not remember sending any emails … I was absolutely wasted so it’s possible I could’ve.”

To be found guilty, prosecutors had to demonstrate that Cruickshank not only sent the threats to kill but intended the recipient to take them seriously.

“The defence was that Mr Cruickshank had no recollection of sending [the death threats], but if he did send them he lacked the necessary intent primarily because of intoxication. There can be no issue that intoxication was at the heart of the defence,” judge Simon France wrote in the court of appeal decision.

The court ruled that “intoxication can be taken into account when assessing whether a defendant had the required intent” and because this was not set out clearly to the jury, it “left the jury in doubt as to the relevance, if any, of Mr Cruickshank’s alleged drunken state”. As a result, the court ruled that there had been a miscarriage of justice, overturning his conviction. They did not order a retrial.

Cruickshank’s threats to Ardern came in the wake of 88 emails he had sent to government officials over a four-month period, in which he referred to them as criminals and terrorists. His case, described by the original presiding judge as “strik[ing] at the roots of our democracy” emerged amid a spike in death threats aimed at the prime minister.

In June it was reported that threats against Ardern had almost tripled over three years, which police said was driven by a rise in conspiracy movements and a backlash against vaccinations.

That data, released to Newshub under the Official Information Act, showed police in 2021 dealt with 50 threats against the prime minister, up from 32 in 2020 and 18 in 2019. While police could not determine motives for every threat, the documents showed anti-vaccination sentiment was a driving force of a number of them, and opposition to legislation to regulate firearms after the 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks was another factor.

Across parliament, MPs have also reported a rise in abuse, vitriol and threats – particularly against Māori women. According to police data released under the Official Information Act to 1News in January, threats towards MPs reached a three-year high in 2021.

> Survivors thank New Zealanders outside court for their support after news that mosque gunman will never leave jail

Christchurch shooting: mosque gunman sentenced to life without parole


Crowds gathered outside Christchurch high court and sang Stand By Me as months of pent-up stress and tension gave way to relief after the sentencing of the mosque gunman to life in prison without parole.

Traditional Māori songs followed, as members of the Muslim community responded with jubilant chants of Allahu Akbar, God is Great.

The shouts and cheers emerged from the mingled crowd as the realisation sank in that the community was safe from a mass murderer who would never walk free.

“Yes I have lost my brother in law but I have now five million brothers and sisters,” one man, Bader Dokhan, told reporters.

Those leaving court waved and made peace signs with their hands, with one young man scattering white rose petals in the air.

Abdul Aziz Wahabzadah, the man who chased the terrorist away from the second mosque, mounted the security barricade outside court to huge cheers, while police snipers guarded the scene from the rooftops.

He had “never forgotten” the support New Zealanders had given him, he said. “We are all brothers and sisters.”

The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said she hoped the victims had “felt the arms of New Zealand around them” and reiterated her commitment to never speaking the terrorist’s name, saying he deserved “a lifetime of complete and utter silence”.

She said like many New Zealanders she had felt “relief to know that person will never see the light of day”.

Deputy prime minister Winston Peters said: “The judgment is the only one that matched the depravity of the terrorist’s crimes against the Islamic community, and its devastating effect on all people living in this country.” He also called for Brenton Tarrant, an Australian, to be deported “to the country that raised him”.

Gamal Fouda, the Al Noor mosque imam who told worshippers to get on the floor when the shooting began, said outside court: “We are the winners and the terrorist is the loser.”

Alisha Siddique said she was satisfied that the man who shot her father “will rot in jail for life”. She added: “We can only heal from here.”

Latef Alabi, who was leading prayers at Linwood mosque when the attack happened, said the terrorist had failed to divide New Zealand and he had made “the best decision of his life” by moving to the country, where “justice had been served”.

“Wherever you come from, you were born the same, the same way we were born. We live the same way, and we die the same way. There is no difference between any one of us. Your identity and behaviour differentiates you.

“It doesn’t matter what colour you are. Today I thank everyone around the world to please, always choose the best, to be kind, to be clean from inside, and you will remain the best until you die.”

Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said that while the sentencing was an important milestone in the judicial process, it should not overshadow the incredible determination and survival of victims.

“New Zealand and the world have felt the pain of the Muslim community and the horror of such a hateful and senseless act committed in our own backyard, against our own people,” Coster said.

“We responded to this event with unity and our communities came closer together, which is ultimately what will ensure that all people can be safe and feel safe in this country.”

Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said he had called Ardern to convey his relief over Tarrant’s sentence.

“Justice today was delivered to the terrorist and murderer for his cowardly and horrific crimes in Christchurch. It is right that we will never see or hear from him ever again.” Morrison said.“New Zealand is family to us. Today, we send our love across ‘the ditch’”

Tarrant killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March last year.

Judge Mander ruled that he would spend the rest of his life in jail – the first time under current New Zealand law that a sentence of life without the possibility of parole has been imposed.

“You committed mass murder,” said Mander. “You slaughtered unarmed and defenceless people.

“You have offered no apology or public acknowledgement of the harms you have caused,” he added. “While I appreciate that you have forsaken the opportunity to use these proceedings as a platform, you appear neither contrite nor ashamed.”

In the public gallery there was little reaction to Tarrant’s sentencing and he was led away from the docks in silence by four guards.

## 127, Two years after Christchurch, New Zealand makes plotting a terrorist attack a crime

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/30/new-zealand-makes-plotting-a-terrorist-attack-a-fixing-legal-loophole

> Changes to the law were recommended after the 2019 Christchurch shootings and sped up after a supermarket knife attack earlier this month

New Zealand has passed a law that makes plotting a terrorist attack a crime, fixing a legal loophole that was exposed earlier this month by a violent knife attack.

The new law had been months in the planning but was hurried through parliament after an extremist inspired by the Islamic State group grabbed a knife at an Auckland supermarket on 3 September and began stabbing shoppers. He wounded five while two others were injured in the chaos. All are still recovering.

Police officers shot and killed the extremist, Ahamed Aathil Samsudeen, after they said they confronted him in the supermarket and he charged at them with the knife. Authorities had been following him for 53 days straight, worried he planned to launch an attack at any moment after he was released from prison in July. However, police had found no legal reason to detain him.

A year earlier, prosecutors had unsuccessfully tried to charge Samsudeen with terrorism after he bought a large hunting knife and was found with violent Islamic State videos.

Prosecutors argued there was evidence he bought the knife with the intention of killing people and to further an ideological cause. But a judge ruled the act of buying a knife wasn’t enough to proceed with the case.

The judge found New Zealand’s anti-terror laws didn’t specifically cover plots. That “could be an achilles heel,” the judge acknowledged at the time, adding that it was not up to a court to create new laws.

After the attack this month, prime minister Jacinda Ardern vowed to pass the new legislation by the end of September. But Ardern also said that even had the new law been in place, it may not necessarily have stopped Samsudeen.

“This bill strengthens our counter-terrorism laws to better prevent and respond,” said lawmaker Ginny Andersen, from the liberal Labour party. “And these changes will also enable police to intervene earlier. If it saves lives, and makes New Zealanders safer, I believe that is a good thing.”

New Zealand’s terrorism laws date back to soon after the 11 September, 2001, attacks in the US. Changes to these laws were recommended after a 2019 attack, in which a white supremacist gunman killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch during Friday prayers.

The conservative National party joined Labour in voting in favour of the bill, which passed by 98 votes to 22. But some of Ardern’s traditional liberal allies in parliament voted against it.

The Green party said their members were worried the new law had been rushed through without enough consultation, and that the definition of terrorism had been expanded to the extent it risked capturing “direct action, activism, and protest.”

The Greens said they were also worried that some experts had characterised the new offence as a “thought crime”, and that accompanying powers allowing authorities to carry out warrantless searches increased the risk for human rights abuses.

The new crime of planning a terrorist attack comes with a maximum penalty of seven years’ imprisonment. The bill also criminalises travel to or from New Zealand to carry out an attack, and weapons or combat training for a terrorist attack.

Ardern has also been examining whether changes are needed to New Zealand‘s deportation laws and policies after authorities cancelled Samsudeen’s refugee status on the basis of fraud in 2019 and ordered him deported back to Sri Lanka. An appeal by Samsudeen was still pending when he launched his attack.

## 128, Even as New Zealand battles Covid, trust in government bucks global trend

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/30/even-as-new-zealand-battles-covid-trust-in-government-bucks-global-trend

> With a nationwide lockdown and some of the world’s strictest restrictions, Jacinda Ardern is counting on her people’s goodwill again

In locked-down New Zealand, life orbits around the 1pm briefing. As the home-bound nation digests its lunch, the director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield – frequently alongside prime minister Jacinda Ardern – takes the stage behind a socially distanced podium and updates the country.

In the midst of a Covid outbreak, those briefings occur almost every weekday. They are so clockwork-regular, so predictable in their essential structure, that certain sentences became memes: “Kia ora koutou katoa. There are X cases of Covid-19 in the community,” each begins. After the last outbreak, media outlet The Spinoff spliced together Bloomfield saying it 44 times.

“It became kind of a cultural phenomenon,” says science communication expert Rebecca Priestley, of Victoria University’s Centre for Science in Society. “We were getting information directly from the prime minister and from the director general of health and other representatives in a way that’s quite unusual.”

Over the past year, those briefings became a subject of study for researchers examining how political communication can fuel trust and mobilise populations. They are, researchers say, just part of the answer to why trust levels in New Zealand have remained high – even as in some countries trust in governments and other institutions has slumped.

This month, the government has had to lean into that trust again. After discovering one case of Covid-19 in the community on 17 August, the country went into a nationwide lockdown, with some of the strictest restrictions in the world. As of Monday, it had recorded 562 cases. It is New Zealand’s first major outbreak in more than a year, and is on track to become its largest. On Friday, Ardern said that Auckland, the country’s biggest city, was likely to stay in level 4 lockdown for at least two more weeks.

And yet, restrictive as it may be, New Zealanders overwhelmingly back the government’s approach. Recent polling found the lockdown had support from 84% of the population. New Zealand’s embrace of elimination rankled some overseas commentators, who accused the country’s government of “nannying its population into isolation and quiescence”.

But experts say that trust and social capital could prove crucial to countries emerging from the pandemic – as well as boosting their chances of solving myriad other social problems.

Many countries’ trust in their governments has been sputtering for years. Last year in the UK, trust dropped to its lowest point in decades. In the US, it’s trended down for 60 years. The 2021 Edelman Trust Barometer diagnosed “an epidemic of misinformation and widespread mistrust of societal institutions and leaders around the world.”

In some countries, the Covid-19 pandemic cracked already fragile pillars further. A Pew Research study from last year found people in most advanced economies around the world, including 88% of Americans, believed their society was now more divided than before the pandemic. After brief boosts early in the pandemic – what Edelman researchers called the “spring trust bubble” – trust levels fell back by 15 percentage points in the UK, 11 in Canada, and six in the US.

In New Zealand, however, the opposite has been true. According to Pew, 75% of people there believed their society was more unified in 2020 than pre-Covid – the second-highest in the world, beaten only by Singapore. Researchers measuring New Zealand’s trust pre- and post-lockdown found the lockdown group reported higher trust in science, politicians and police, and higher levels of patriotism.

But local trust in government is not purely an offshoot of a highly successful Covid response. Victoria University researchers surveying trust levels in 2016 found New Zealand trust in government across a range of measures was low – sitting at 45%. As some countries became increasingly mistrustful, however, New Zealand bucked the trend.

When the survey was repeated in 2018, trust had leapt to 64%, nearly a 20 percentage point rise. “That’s a big upward shift that we hadn’t expected,” says Simon Chapple, co-author of the study and director of the Institute for Governance and Policy Studies. “It’s really quite astounding.” Trust skyrocketed again after the initial Covid-19 response, to 83%, then settled back in the high 60s.

Social scientists say the questions of social and political trust – how to get it, how to keep it, how it’s lost or maintained – can have crucial implications. People with higher levels of trust in government are far more willing to receive a vaccine, for example, Chapple says. But the implications also extend far beyond Covid.

“For any significant policy change, you typically need a significant community consensus that crosses political boundaries,” he says. Other huge challenges, such as the climate crisis, will require revolutions in behaviour. When people don’t trust their leaders, their institutions or each other, it’s much harder for them to solve the social problems that require huge collective action.

“There’s a version in the data of what social scientists call the Matthew effect,” Chapple says, referring to a passage in the gospel of Matthew: “‘To he that hath, shall be given.’ So high-trust institutions, trust in them increased. But low-trust institutions banged along at the same level, or fell slightly – there’s an increasing gap.’’ The same can apply to whole governments: it’s much easier to lose trust than to gain it, and easier to increase trust when you’re already well perceived.

It’s hard to find high-quality data on trust in government, and it can depend on a complex tangle of factors – economic performance, inequality, political personalities, social capital. After disasters, trust often jumps, but it’s not guaranteed. People facing a shared threat sometimes “rally around the flag” and put their trust in institutions and each other because they have few other options – but they can also respond with greater suspicion, developing conspiracy theories or scapegoats to blame.

Ardern’s communication has been heralded as a key part of taking New Zealanders along with her – not just during Covid, but in other crises, such as the Christchurch mosque attacks. After New Zealand’s first national lockdown, Priestley and researcher Alex Beattie ran language analysis of the 1pm briefings, coding hours of transcripts.

Over and over again, Priestley says, “the lockdown was framed as something that both the government and New Zealanders were responsible for”. That frame of collective responsibility, she says, helped transform the experience of lockdowns from an essentially disempowering, top-down experience, to a communal effort. “Very early on, Jacinda Ardern said, ‘as a government, we will do everything in our power to protect you. Now I’m asking you to do everything you can to protect all of us’,” Priestley says.

“Speaking directly to people about the impact their actions had, that was quite powerful.”

But while communication can help ease populations’ suspicions of their governments, trust is not just some vague sentiment, divorced from material circumstance. Over the past two years, it has been borne out by many New Zealanders’ life experience. The vast majority have not had to watch their families sicken or die of Covid-19. The public health system has not been overwhelmed. Droves have not found themselves unemployed or facing eviction.

“In the case of New Zealand, one of the things that’s been cited especially in the Covid response was having that economic safety net there, and in other places that wasn’t forthcoming,” says the co-director of the Public Policy Institute, Lara Greaves.

She notes that it’s hard to get high-quality data, and trust in New Zealand is not a universal sentiment – Māori and Pacific communities are less likely to trust the government, and institutions such as the police. But Greaves says that New Zealand’s proportional political system means that, while parties might dabble in “culture war” rhetoric and divisions, they tend not to go all-out.

Trust “depends as well on the extent to which populism and this idea of commonsense regular people versus elites – whether that kind of ideology is present, and whether there are parties in the system that are bringing that ideology up a lot,” Greaves says. “We haven’t seen a political party – one that’s legitimately represented in parliament … really do that.”

Chapple adds: “We’ve escaped the worst of the culture wars that have created these schisms in the [United] States and the UK and Australia. Those culture wars have been very destructive of trust in one’s fellow citizens. They’re also very distracting – they encourage debate about issues that take attention away from fundamental things like how do we adapt to climate change … long-term existential problems get caught up in short-term noise.”

In New Zealand, political consensus has endured so far, with cross-party support for the country’s elimination strategy. There is no anti-mask brigade in parliament, and little political appetite for a snap reopening that could cost thousands of lives. As the current lockdown stretches into the next month, it remains to be seen how that trust will last.

“There are rational reasons why politicians have acted in that way in the US and UK – and they do get very short-term results,” Chapple says. “But there will be long-term costs, and other consequences.”



## 129, As the Christchurch shooter faces sentencing, what has Australia learned about far-right terror?

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/23/as-the-christchurch-shooter-faces-sentencing-what-has-australia-learned-about-far-right-terror

> The massacre drew authorities’ attention to Australian extremists, but Covid has given the toxic movements fresh impetus

In the weeks after the New Zealand Christchurch massacre, the attention of the international media turned to a small town on the New South Wales mid-north coast.

Grafton, population 18,000, is the home town of the far-right extremist who killed 51 people at two mosques in March last year. Previously best known for its annual jacaranda festival, the town quickly became a beacon for journalists searching for clues about the gunman’s past in the wake of the shooting.

Nine News interviewed the gunman’s grandmother, who described him as “an ordinary chap” who liked computers. The New York Times spoke to former neighbours who remembered him playing in the streets as a child. A family friend described him as “introverted” and “quiet” to the Guardian.

All of this fossicking was geared towards trying to understand how Australia had produced one of the most heinous terrorists in modern history. What secrets was this unremarkable town on the banks of the Clarence River hiding?

“The individual who carried out the attacks does not represent us, nor does he represent the values and beliefs of our wider community,” Clarence Valley deputy mayor Jason Kingsley felt compelled to say at the time.

“This is an act of an individual, and our hearts go out to our brothers and sisters in Christchurch.”

But as Brenton Tarrant prepares to be sentenced for 51 charges for murder, 40 attempted murders and New Zealand’s first terrorism offence, the question of what Australia has learned from the massacre looms large.

Perhaps more than any of the dozens of high-profile acts of far-right violence committed across the globe in recent years, the Christchurch massacre typified the transnational and deeply online nature of the far right.

From the document the perpetrator posted online before the shooting, the messages he scrawled on the weapons he used and his links to the European Identitarian movement, it was clear he wanted to brand himself as a member of a larger global community.

Certainly the links to the far right in Australia were real enough. After the shooting, the leader of an Australian white nationalist group said he had previously approached the Christchurch shooter to join his Lad’s Society, and an investigation by the ABC found he had posted online comments supporting another Australian far-right group, the United Patriots Front, as early as April 2016.

He also praised the UPF founder, Blair Cottrell, as the “true leader of the nationalist movement in Australia” and dubbed him “Emperor” on the night of Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 US election.

Cottrell has said he did not know the gunman and recently described him as “an idiot”.

After the shooting, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, called it a “vicious, murderous attack” on people of faith, and described the gunman as “an extremist, rightwing violent terrorist”.

“Names imply some sort of humanity and I struggle to see how anyone who would engage in this sort of hate and violence is human. He doesn’t deserve a name,” he said.

But it was the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, who became the public face of attempts to grapple with far-right violence, co-chairing a summit in Paris with French president Emmanuel Macron, known as the Christchurch Call, which aimed to convince tech companies to suppress terrorist and violent extremist content online.

The push has been a partial success, and, according to Charles Sturt University terrorism expert Kristy Campion, has helped play a role in forcing many far-right figures, including those in Australia, from mainstream social media platforms.

“I went to New Zealand after the shooting and spent time talking to survivors and a couple of people from the government and it was incredibly impressive to see how they were approaching it,” Campion told Guardian Australia.

“They weren’t othering the issue by saying he was Australian so it’s not our problem, but said we’re going to approach this holistically and see what we can do to make sure New Zealand remains safe.

“In Australia I think there is a great deal happening amongst security agencies but perhaps unfortunately we don’t see it as much. They are engaging with people in the field and expanding their knowledge about these networks but it’s not the sort of thing that happens in public.”

Australia’s police and intelligence agencies have become more vocal in raising their concerns about the threat of far-right extremism in the wake of the shooting. In February, the director general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Mike Burgess, said the threat of violent extremism from the right was “real and growing”.

“In suburbs around Australia, small cells regularly meet to salute Nazi flags, inspect weapons, train in combat and share their hateful ideology,” Burgess said.

Speaking in Canberra as part of Asio’s annual threat assessment address, Burgess paid particular attention to links between Australians and international white supremacist hate groups such as The Base.

“While we would expect any rightwing extremist-inspired attack in Australia to be low capability, ie a knife, gun or vehicle attack, more sophisticated attacks are possible,” he said.

That threat has apparently only increased during the Covid-19 pandemic. In June, the ABC reported that a threat assessment sent to security professionals by Asio warned that the far-right was using Covid-19 as cover to reach a new audience, exploiting the social isolation wrought by the pandemic to push extremist ideology.

“Covid-19 restrictions are being exploited by extreme rightwing narratives that paint the state as oppressive, and globalisation and democracy as flawed and failing,” Asio warned.

“We assess the Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced an extreme rightwing belief in the inevitability of societal collapse and a ‘race war’.”

While much of the mainstream attention during the pandemic in Australia has focused on conspiracy groups such as QAnon, the Sovereign Citizen movement and various anti-vaccination proponents, the lines between fringe ideas have increasingly blurred in the wake of Covid-19.

As Guardian Australia reported earlier this month, the pandemic has provided an umbrella under which a broad movement of conspiracy groups have to some extent coalesced, and the far right has not missed the opportunity to grab a piece of the action.

Campion, who is researching how rightwing extremists have capitalised on community uncertainty during the pandemic to drive their own agendas, said the pandemic had “managed to achieve what the Unite the Right rallies didn’t”.

“In that that’s what it took for these very fractious, distinct and often conflicting elements of the far right and beyond to actually come together,” she said.

While many of the big social media companies have taken steps to remove far-right figures from their platforms, in the places where they still lurk veterans of the movement in Australia have kept up a steady stream of commentary on Covid-19.

That, Campion says, points to the limits of controlling far-right extremism by policing online spaces.

“Websites alone are not capable of [radicalising people],” she said.

“What it really needs is community, and what we can observe is that people might regularly be at a website but that community doesn’t stay online. Groups in Australia that have had sites taken down are already on Gab or Telegram or various other apps, creating a very insular community.”

## 130, Jacinda Ardern greets Prince William with Māori hongi in New Zealand

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/25/prince-william-receives-traditional-maori-greeting-in-new-zealand

> Duke of Cambridge and New Zealand prime minister press noses during visit to honour those affected by the Christchurch attacks

Prince William has joined Jacinda Ardern at Anzac commemorations in New Zealand in the wake of the Christchurch mosque attacks.

The pair shared an intimate hongi [Māori nose press] and espoused the values of freedom, democracy, and peace where they attended a service in Auckland before travelling to Christchurch to meet with survivors.

Six weeks after a lone gunman shot 50 people dead at two Christchurch mosques, the Duke of Cambridge arrived in the city to pay his respects to and share in the city’s grief in the wake of the worst attacks in the country’s modern history.

Amid a heightened security presence at Anzac services, with dozens of services cancelled due to security risks, prime minister Ardern said the day was an important reminder to recommit to simple values and not take life – or peace – for granted.

“There is more that unites us than divides us,” Ardern said.

William is visiting New Zealand on behalf of the Queen, in a visit designed to honour the victims of the March 15 attack, which has come back into the news in the wake of the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka upon hotels and churches, which the Sri Lankan defence minister said may have been carried out as a reprisal for the mosque shootings.

No stranger to a city in mourning, William also visited Christchurch following the February 2011 earthquake, which claimed 185 lives.

“I’m really pleased that he can make a short visit to support those affected by the attack and pay tribute to the extraordinary compassion and solidarity that New Zealanders have displayed in recent weeks,” Ardern said of the prince’s two-day visit.

“The Duke has a close connection with New Zealand and in particular Christchurch. His visit provides the opportunity to pay tribute to those affected by the mosque terrorist attacks and show support to the local and national community.”

William attended the Auckland Anzac service with the prime minister before travelling to Christchurch on Thursday afternoon where he met with survivors of the terror attacks and their families, as well as first responders and the wider Muslim community.

The duke will do a public walkabout in the garden city on Friday afternoon, but otherwise there is little known about his itinerary, which is being kept under wraps for security reasons, as the country remains at medium risk of a terror attack.

There had been a significant security presence accompanying William and the visit has been without the crowds and festive atmosphere that often accompany a royal visit.

## 131, Jacinda Ardern facing biggest challenge yet as New Zealand switches to Covid suppression

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/09/jacinda-ardern-facing-biggest-challenge-yet-as-new-zealand-switches-to-covid-suppression

> The prime minister has enjoyed huge support during the pandemic – but the country’s new course may force unpopular trade-offs

This week, New Zealand’s locked-down cities woke to a brave new world of lifted restrictions: state-sanctioned picnics in parks, the prospect of reopening schools, a chance to reunite with friends and family. Infusing the visions of grass-stained blankets and beachside beers, however, is a strong dose of Covid anxiety. Cases continue to circulate in the community, and the country’s long-held commitment to elimination is being been cast off.

As New Zealand steps into the unknown with its Covid approach, so does its prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. Having brought the country through the pandemic largely unscathed so far, she was richly rewarded with political popularity and trust. Now the prime minister faces the difficult task of guiding it through a new era of Covid suppression – and it could be the most significant political challenge she has faced yet.

“There’s going to be ongoing restrictions, more cases, more deaths – and that’s something New Zealand hasn’t really seen yet,” says Clint Smith, a political communications worker and former communications strategist for Ardern.

“This is where it almost becomes ‘real’ for New Zealanders. The elimination strategy has meant that we haven’t faced the cases, and the deaths, and the restrictions in our daily lives in the way that people overseas have for the last year and a half. Keeping our collective heads up and focused on the solutions is going to be a huge challenge.”

One of the great virtues of New Zealand’s Covid-zero strategy was its clarity and simplicity. On posters and in press conferences, it could be distilled into a few words: stay home. Eliminate the virus. Save lives. Phasing that out means New Zealand steps out of black and white and into the endless greys of pandemic management, a realm of marginal calls and no-win decisions.

The country must transition from a single, front-loaded trade-off – harsh lockdowns and closed borders exchanged for a Covid-free life – to thousands of individual ones, each with its own bitter costs. Precisely how many deaths are too many? Do the benefits of opening schools outweigh the risks of Covid infections among unvaccinated children? Are cafes, picnics and shopping malls a worthy swap for higher death tolls among indigenous people?

These are the decisions governments make constantly, says political analyst Dr Lara Greaves, but Covid-19 forces them to make calls in a particularly brutal and public way.

“A lot of the decisions in policy and governance are around balancing things like finances and economics with the cost of human life, or the cost of a good year of a human life,” Greaves says.

“People always say, ‘you don’t want to see how a sausage is made’, and this is kind of along those lines – it’s that stuff behind the scenes that’s happening in government, those trade-offs that we don’t [usually] see as the general public.”

Often, those marginal trade-offs are ugly, and Ardern’s government hasn’t been forced to make this many of them before.

Fracturing a single large decision into thousands of smaller ones also makes the strategy harder to communicate, and easier to argue over. Elimination was so popular with voters that every major political party backed it.

But over the past two weeks, the National, Act and Green parties have all peeled off from the government, vocally denouncing the new approach or offering new plans of their own. Ardern and her ministers continue to equivocate on whether elimination is over at all – a hemming and hawing that Smith says could hinder them from communicating a clear new vision for New Zealand’s path forward.

In one sense, Ardern could now be a victim of her own success, says Ben Thomas, a communications consultant and former National government staffer. The government’s elimination campaign was so compelling and its results so strong, that it won huge support – polling above 80% through most of the pandemic.

“Part of the prime minister’s problem is that she did such a good job of rallying New Zealanders to this cause, of convincing them – correctly – that elimination was an achievable goal, and of instilling a real fear of the virus. That’s a very hard thing to unwind from,” Thomas says.

Smith says: “Elimination was something that New Zealanders could be proud of, it brought us together and became a common goal.” And the challenge now is to find – what is the common goal during a suppression strategy? Probably vaccination rates – but to give us this same pride that we had last year in our Covid response again that is the big challenge facing Jacinda and her team now.”

The most likely candidate for that new vision is vaccination, but it’s harder to capture the urgency of that message while simultaneously arguing the country is still eliminating the virus.

New Zealand’s vaccine rollout got off to a slow start. Their problem wasn’t unique – a number of countries successful in initial responses to Covid, including Australia and Japan, had similar delays securing vaccine supply. In April, Ardern said New Zealand’s delivery schedule was slower than countries because its population was “not dying while they wait”.

Uptake since large shipments of doses began arriving has been strong, and at one point, New Zealand was administering more daily doses per 1,000 people than any other country. As of this weekend, 67% of the total population and 79% of the eligible (12+) population have had at least one dose. 53% of those eligible are fully immunised, or 45% of the full population. That’s a couple of percentage points behind Australia, far behind the UK, and will probably overtake the US in the coming weeks. The government is aiming to vaccinate everyone willing with at least one dose by end of year – but even if it succeeds, that could still leave months of Covid purgatory ahead, where large chunks of the population remain unprotected.

If New Zealanders are unhappy with the new approach, it is not yet clear how much it will hurt Labour’s leadership in the polls. In the 2020 election, Labour won enough seats to govern alone – a rare outcome in New Zealand’s typically coalition-based political system, and a ringing endorsement of the Covid response.

“Ardern’s mammoth victory last year was wholly a result of the pandemic and Covid response,” says Thomas. “First of all because of the outstanding health outcomes – very low Covid deaths. The social outcomes – being largely untouched by lockdowns for most of the year, unlike a lot of our peer countries. But the third thing was the really strong economic rebound … which made older voters or traditionally conservative voters swing over to the government.”

If those gains start to dissolve, so too could some of that political support.

But if Ardern stumbles in the next stages of the pandemic, the opposition may be too fragmented and dysfunctional to take advantage of it. While Labour’s polling has already dropped from the historic highs of the last election, the Labour-Greens bloc has maintained a majority, and in the preferred prime minister stakes, Ardern is light years ahead of her opposition: polling at 44%, versus National leader Judith Collins’ 5%.

“Labour’s popularity had already slipped before the latest outbreak, and the National party spectacularly failed to capitalise on that,” Thomas says. “The laws of political gravity say National should benefit from [a Labour drop]. If they can’t capitalise under these circumstances, there’s something very wrong with the leadership and with the party.”

And while New Zealand is now entering a tougher stage of the pandemic than those it has passed through before, Ardern tends to be at her best in a crisis – from the 15 March 2019 Christchurch terrorist attacks to the Whakaari volcanic eruption, to the early days of the pandemic.

“We’ve seen Ardern provide a vision in moments of crisis again and again,” Smith says. “It has been the defining aspect of her prime ministership. And she’s now in the position of having to come up with a new vision.”

## 132, Facebook trained its AI to block violent live streams after Christchurch attacks

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/29/facebook-trained-its-ai-to-block-violent-live-streams-after-christchurch-attacks

> Leaked papers detail emergency exercise that followed 2019 mass murder in New Zealand

Facebook trained its artificial intelligence systems to detect and block any future attempt to livestream a shooting spree with “police/military body cams footage,” and other violent material, in the aftermath of the Christchurch terror attack.

The emergency exercise – detailed in corporate papers leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen – followed the March 2019 mass murder in the New Zealand city, described internally as “a watershed moment” for the Facebook Live video service.

The white supremacist attacker was able to broadcast a 17-minute live stream of the attack on two mosques that was not detected by the company’s systems, allowing it to be swiftly replicated online. 1.5m uploads had to be removed in the 24 hours afterwards.

“It was clear that Live was a vulnerable surface which can be repurposed by bad actors to cause societal harm,” the leaked review stated. “Since this event, we’ve faced international media pressure and have seen regulatory and legal risks increase on Facebook increase considerably.”

At the time Facebook admitted its AI systems had failed to prevent the broadcast, and the video was only removed after the company was alerted by New Zealand police. No Facebook user complained for 29 minutes and executives were forced to admit its detection systems were “not perfect”.

The leaked documents, initially published by Gizmodo, underscore the failure, showing that at the time of Christchurch, the social media giant was “only able to detect violations five mins into a broadcast” – and that the attack video only scored 0.11 on an internal graphic violence scale when the threshold for intervention was 0.65.

It also details how Facebook grappled with the problem, trying to improve its cutting edge technology. A key element was to retrain its company’s AI video detection systems by feeding it a dataset of harmful content, to work out what to highlight and block.

“The training dataset includes videos like police/military body cams footage, recreational shooting and simulations,” the internal material says, plus “videos from the military” obtained from by the company’s law enforcement outreach team. It also included first person shooter video game footage, as examples of content not to block.

As a result of this and other efforts, the documents show that Facebook believed it had slashed the detection time from five minutes to 12 seconds. The Christchurch video now scored 0.96 on the internal graphic violence scale, well above the intervention threshold.

Elsewhere, this set of leaked documents show how keen Facebook was to repair its damaged image. The company admitted it had “minimal restrictions in place to prevent risky actors going to live” and in May 2019 announced a “one strike” policy that blocked accounts with a single terror violation from using Live for 30 days.

The change was announced in tandem with the Christchurch summit held in Paris, aimed at eliminating terrorist content online. In what Facebook described as “a major PR win”, the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, used “FB live to update her followers after the announcement”.

We’re going to wrap up the blog for the day, thank you for following along. Here’s what’s happened today:

With the kind cooperation of the @ChristchurchCC, I've uploaded the photo of Jacinda Ardern visiting the Muslim community to Commons under an open CC BY licence: https://t.co/wAXS85rMmT Please credit: 📷 Christchurch City Council Newsline/Kirk Hargreaves https://t.co/G1xa5qYVIA pic.twitter.com/OsObSXKWUV

Today the Prime Minister announced an inquiry into the attack, a move we at Police welcome.It is important we learn any lessons we can from this tragedy.She also spoke about surrendering firearms.

As per existing processes we are happy for people to surrender their firearms to Police.

We would ask that they please call their local Police Station or Arms officer first for advice on the safe transport of the firearm to Police and to alert our staff ahead of time, given the current situation.

Finally, I want to thank the public for their overwhelmingly positive feedback and messages of support.I know it is greatly appreciated by our staff who work tirelessly to keep our community safe - @NZPCommissioner

An 18-year-old man was denied bail at a court in New Zealand on Monday after he was charged with distributing a live stream of the mass shooting at a mosque last week, the New Zealand Herald reported.

The man was arrested on Friday, but police have since said they do not believe he was directly involved in the attacks at two mosques in Christchurch which happened on the same day, in which 50 worshippers were killed.

He faces charges of sharing the gunman’s live-stream and posting a photograph of one of the mosques attacked with the message “target acquired” along with other chat messages “inciting extreme violence”, the Herald reported.

His request for bail was refused but the judge granted him name suppression. He is due back in court next month.

The teen was initially charged with publishing material insulting other races and ethnicities but that charge was withdrawn and replaced by the two new charges on Monday.

The ABC’s Indonesia correspondent reports that this morning Indonesia called in its Australian ambassador to convey strong condemnation over Fraser Anning’s statements.

The Australian government has issued updated travel advice for Australian tourists, warning them that “demonstrations and protests against Australia may occur” in response to the attack. Smartraveller warned Australians to “avoid demonstrations and protests, as they can turn violent” and to report suspicious behaviour.

The full advice is here:

The shocking and unprecedented events in Christchurch on 15 March continue to reverberate globally.

The terrorist attack, motivated by extreme right-wing ideology, has drawn strong condemnation internationally.

Demonstrations and protests against Australia may occur.

Australians travelling overseas should continue to use common sense, be vigilant and exercise caution. They should look out for and report suspicious behaviour, as they would in Australia. They should monitor the media and other sources for information about possible new safety or security threats, and follow the advice of local authorities. They should avoid demonstrations and protests, as they can turn violent.

Australia keeps its travel advisories under constant review, and will continue to assess whether the risks for Australians travelling have changed.

The safety and security of Australians in Australia and overseas is our highest priority.

New Zealand’s police chief said on Monday that they are certain there was only one attacker involved in the mass shooting in Christchurch last week.

“I want to definitely state that we believe that there was only one attacker responsible for this horrendous event,” Police Commissioner Mike Bush told a media conference.

“That doesn’t mean there weren’t possibly other people in support, and that continues to form a very, very important part of our investigation,” he added.

Bush said this is the largest investigation ever undertaken by the New Zealand police, involving more than 200 NZ police and experts, as well as investigators from the FBI and the Australian Federal Police.

Bush said he the threat level in New Zealand remained high and New Zealanders would continue to see high vigilance from the police, to ensure everyone in New Zealand feels safe.

He also thanked the public for their “absolutely overwhelming positive support” to members of the police and emergency services. “It has been absolutely heartwarming, the commentary that we’re getting about our people... we could not be more proud of our people.”

The New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS) has released a statement saying they welcome the inquiry into the Christchurch terrorist attacks, announced by Jacinda Ardern in her press conference this afternoon.

“I welcome the inquiry announced today. There are important questions which need answers,” said Rebecca Kitteridge, the director-general of security.

“We embrace the opportunity to learn from this terrible experience. Our work must often be carried out in secret, but I am a big believer in transparency where possible.

“I am always limited in what I can say about individuals and that’s especially the case while there is an active police investigation.

“The person charged with murder has not ever been brought to the attention of NZSIS and is not known to NZSIS or our Australian counterpart.

“Over the last nine months, NZSIS has increased its effort to obtain a better picture of the threat posed to New Zealand by far right extremist groups. The NZSIS has over recent years received a number of tips from the public concerning right wing extremism and has taken each one seriously.”

My colleague Helen Davidson has this story of the police officers who arrested the Christchurch shooting suspect. The officers, who were visiting from a rural Canterbury station have been praised as heroes for their actions.

The pair, who were in the city for a training session on dealing with armed offenders, represented the professionalism of the police force, said Chris Cahill, the president of the New Zealand Police Association. “The ability to make quick decisions to go forward and act made all police officers in New Zealand and around the world incredibly proud,” he said.

Police commissioner Mike Bush, said on Sunday the suspect was “non compliant”, and the officers – who remained unidentified – “had to use some force and tactical options”. “They put themselves in harm’s way to stop any further attack and I do believe they did prevent further attacks.”

Does Christchurch have a problem with racism? asks a journalist.

Ardern says she wants to reiterate the comments of Winston Peters and remind people: “In this case, the primary suspect here, the person who was arrested was not a citizen of New Zealand.”

But she continues: “That is not to say that there are not those who live in New Zealand who have values and ideas and use language that is counter to what the vast majority of New Zealanders believe. We cannot ignore that. If we are to ensure the safety of Muslims and others, the 200 ethnicities in New Zealand, we have to be alive to the fact there are those who do not share our values of openness.”

## 135, Far-right extremists still threaten New Zealand, a year on from the Christchurch attacks

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/far-right-extremists-still-threaten-new-zealand-a-year-on-from-the-christchurch-attacks

> I worry we don’t have enough resources and skills locally to adequately monitor threats in our community

In the hours after the Christchurch mosque attacks on March 15 last year, I wrote that I hoped New Zealand would finally stop believing it was immune to far-right extremist violence. A year on, I’m not sure enough has changed.

I’ve researched far-right extremism for decades – and I would argue it remains a high-level threat in New Zealand, not just overseas.

My assessment is that there are about 60 to 70 groups and somewhere between 150 and 300 core, right-wing activists in New Zealand.

This sounds modest alongside the estimated 12,000 to 13,000 violent far-right activists in Germany. But proportionate to population size, the numbers are similar for both countries. And it only takes one activist to act out his extremism.

In the past year, there has certainly been greater investment by New Zealand’s security agencies in monitoring extremist groups and activists. There has been more media coverage. The government moved quickly to ban assault weapons and further controls on the use and possession of arms are underway. Other initiatives, including a royal commission of inquiry, are pending.

But I also feel there is a tendency to see the Christchurch attacks, which killed 51 people, as a one-off or an aberration – rather than something we still need to guard against.

New Zealanders should now be more aware than a year ago of the presence of local right-wing extremists. There has been plenty to remind them.

In June last year, Philip Arps, who has been involved in white supremacist activities in Christchurch for some time, was sentenced to 21 months in jail for sharing video of the Christchurch shootings. I am puzzled by the limited public awareness that the imagery on the side of his van – a reference to 14/88 and Nazi signage – was a clear indicator of his extremist views.

Arps was released early in January this year under strict conditions, including a GPS monitor that alerts authorities if he goes near a mosque.

Even though the white nationalist group Dominion Movement folded after the mosque attacks, one of its leaders, a soldier in the New Zealand defence force, was arrested in December last year for “accessing a computer for a dishonest purpose” and disclosing information that “prejudiced the security and defence of New Zealand”. He had been active since 2011 on the neo-Nazi site Stormfront and attended a free speech rally in Wellington in 2018 along with another extreme-right activist.

He also appears to be a member of Wargus Christi, a group formed in September last year by a neo-Nazi, Daniel Waring. It is a “martial-monastic” group of body builders who are homophobic, anti-Semitic and Islamaphobic.

Another group new to New Zealand’s extreme right is Action Zealandia. Their slogan is “building a community for European New Zealanders”. Apart from their online presence, their main public activity is placing stickers in public spaces highlighting their ultra-nationalism.

Information from agencies such as the Southern Poverty Law Center or the Anti-Defamation League in the US shows a significant increase in extremist activity since 2016.

What has been most concerning is that the rise in online hate speech has real-world implications. Research shows an increase in online hate speech will be accompanied by hate crimes in a region or locality. Internet outages reduce both.

In the aftermath of the Christchurch attacks, it was good to see rapid action on limiting automatic weapons. And the Christchurch Call – Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s initiative to stop people using social media to promote terrorism – certainly helped put pressure on online platforms such as Facebook to monitor and remove objectionable material.

But we could move to ban right-wing organisations and put restrictions on individuals who breach agreed thresholds of speech and action. We still do not have clear guidelines for what constitutes hate speech, apart from s61 of the Human Rights Act and the Harmful Digital Communications Act.

I do worry that we don’t have sufficient resources and skills locally to adequately monitor what is happening, even if agencies have been working together more closely internationally.

It would be good to know more from the agencies that have oversight. The New Zealand Security and Intelligence Service (NZSIS) refers to the threat value, but often in relation to international threats.

More openness about their concerns and the extent of local groups and activists would help: for instance, something like Tell MAMA in the UK or the reports other security agencies provide.

It was refreshing to see the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) provide its annual threat assessment in February this year. It assessed the terrorist threat in Australia as probable but the possibility of a right-wing extremist attack as low in terms of capability.

But it acknowledged that advances in technology are “outstripping our technical capabilities”, which must be a concern everywhere.

One thing is certain. The Christchurch mosque attacks have become part of the lexicon whenever white supremacist terrorism is discussed. The events on 15 March have become something of a guide – and, unfortunately, an inspiration to other right-wing terrorists.

It is challenging that many of these extremists are self-radicalised, ideologically motivated, and with a small or no digital footprint. Often there is no prior warning of an attack.

One year on from the attacks, my report card for New Zealand is that we’ve made progress on greater awareness and action. But we still need to do more, including on keeping the public better informed that the problem hasn’t gone away. Just ask those who continue to be targeted.

## 137, The Christchurch attack traumatised us, but we are determined to be happy

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/the-christchurch-attack-traumatised-us-but-we-are-determined-to-be-happy

> Maysoon Salama, whose son was killed in the massacre, says survivors miss their loved ones, but are working hard to bring the community together

At the childcare centre my husband and I run in Christchurch, most of the children would have had somebody in their family who was injured during the attack or knew somebody who was injured.

Five of the children lost parents; lost their fathers. One of them was my granddaughter, Aya. And we had several whose parents were traumatised or injured. Some of the children were hearing a lot of things at home.

We reopened two weeks after the incident and it was clear from day one that mental health had to be our priority for the children. We needed to help them deal with their trauma, and learn how to handle it. They kept asking about one of our students who was wounded in the attacks, and some of them knew that she was injured. It was really a difficult situation.

I approached the education ministry and the prime minister and told them we needed support. I prepared a letter for Jacinda Ardern about mental health and the dire need in the community, short- and long-term.

She did act, and the government was supportive in terms of funding. But their actions were not quick enough. So we started organising help with mental health and started supporting the widows.

We changed the curriculum based on what we thought was good for the children; we didn’t want to overwhelm them. We focused on fun activities, as well as stories related to the loss of loved ones or things, even if it was the loss of a balloon. It’s been working well and our kids are doing much better. They are now happy and bubbly.

As Muslims, we need more opportunities to speak about positive things, rather than just incidents where a Muslim was involved as a terrorist. You hardly ever get this chance. But I think the 15 March incident was an eye-opener for many people, because we were the victims.

For me, I’m a scientist. I have a PhD. But Muslim women are often not acknowledged and given chances, even for work. If you’re wearing the hijab, you don’t even get to the point of an interview, and if you do, then you know the answer is no. Just recently people started acknowledging that, which is one of the positive things that happened after March.

The incident opened a lot of avenues for us. But do we really need a tragedy before we act?

Before this attack, the authorities definitely failed us as Muslims, because we’d been communicating with the police whenever there was a threat, and they would take a report and nothing would happen.

At our childcare centre, we’ve had windows broken several times and people shouting at us from the street. One time my car was covered with blood, with very nasty words that I didn’t even understand until our Kiwi teacher told me what they were.

If we want to announce an activity on social media for the community, we can’t write where it is, and that makes additional work for us.

I’ve been in New Zealand for 25 years, long enough to notice that there is a lot of discrimination towards foreigners in general and Muslims in particular, and lots of discrimination inside the education system. It’s not only students bullying students, it’s teachers bullying students, too. I’ve always raised the point that we need to talk more about other cultures. People say we need to be inclusive, but where’s the action?

Since the mass shooting, I’ve been using my skills and expertise and whatever knowledge I have to participate in things like the royal commission, or inquiry, into whether the attacks could have been prevented. This includes engaging with the government, all the different organisations who are helping, and the ministry of education.

Many of us who are the leaders in these matters are getting tired. I am personally; I just can’t handle all of this. Going through all of this engagement is overwhelming, and you always have to be alert. You have to be really thinking. And sometimes I don’t want to think. We have been training the youth in our community and motivating them, so we’re hoping they can step up.

There have been other changes since the incident. The government agency responsible for ethnic communities has received more funding, and there is a feeling that there should be a focus on social cohesion and activities. A lot of people from the wider community are now also coming and talking to us and appreciating us.

It’s definitely not what the person who did carried out this act would like to hear. His aim was completely the opposite, but he failed miserably. That’s why I want to tell him that we are very good. We’re fine. We’re happy. We miss our loved ones, but we know that they are in a better place. You didn’t achieve anything.

Dr Maysoon Salama is the mother of Atta Elayyan – one of 51 worshippers who died in the Christchurch mosque attacks in March 2019 – and the wife of Mohammad Alayan, who was badly injured. Along with her husband, she runs a Muslim childcare centre in Christchurch, and has been petitioning New Zealand’s government for change in the wake of the massacre. She talked to the Guardian’s Charlotte Graham-McLay.



## 138, If Jacinda Ardern was in No 10, imagine how different Brexit would be

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/26/jacinda-ardern-brexit-theresa-may

> Unlike Theresa May, New Zealand’s prime minister has the leadership qualities to bind a crisis-struck nation together

They are the second and third female prime ministers of their countries. They both preside over minority governments. They have both spent most of their lives in politics. Both have a long-term interest in policing and home affairs. And they have both had to lead as their countries confront one of the greatest man-made crises they have ever faced.

That is where the comparisons end. One has become an international heroine and the other is about to leave office in humiliation as the second worst prime minister ever. In New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern has received near-universal acclaim in the way she has handled the tragic massacres in Christchurch. In the UK, Theresa May has managed to leave the country in the most spectacular mess by the way she has mishandled Brexit.

Comparing the way they have each dealt with the respective crises neatly illustrates what is required of a leader when they face a moment of truth. As Niccolò Machiavelli argued in the 16th century, the two main qualities needed above all else are courage and intelligence.

In New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern demonstrated exemplary courage in moving within days to ban semi-automatic weapons in a country where gun owners are nearly as attached to their weapons as they are in Texas. Unlike successive Democratic presidents in the US who would have liked to do so, she has actually done it. May, by contrast, has never had the courage to confront the extremist fringe of her own party on Brexit. If she had done so at the beginning, instead of adopting their red lines, and aimed for a softer Brexit more in line with her own instincts, she, and we, might be in a better position now.

What Machiavelli meant by intelligence was not IQ, but EQ, emotional intelligence. Roy Jenkins unkindly said of Tony Blair that he had a second-class intellect but a first-class temperament, adapting Wendell Willkie’s famous quote about Franklin D Roosevelt. That is the sort of intelligence a leader needs. They must be able to understand what people feel and channel it, as Blair did at the time of Princess Diana’s death. Ardern managed that brilliantly in the way she expressed the grief of the people of New Zealand about the mass-murder in the mosques. And she made it clear the hate that inspired the murderer would be rejected by all New Zealanders. May, by contrast, has repeatedly demonstrated a tin ear throughout the Brexit fiasco. Most recently she used a TV address to the nation to personally attack the very MPs whose votes she was going to seek the following week.

Part of May’s difficulty arises from the way in which she uses words. It is true that politicians must repeat their ideas again and again until they are heartily sick of them if they hope the public will ever hear them. But from “strong and stable” to “Brexit means Brexit”, she has drained the language of meaning. The discipline is admirable but the effect is to stop people listening. Ardern, on the other hand, seemed effortlessly eloquent in the face of horror and has captured the imagination of the world in the way she rejected intolerance on behalf of all of us. She has almost single-handedly managed to avoid the attacks becoming a cause of further tit-for-tat violence around the world.

The contrast is not just about their qualities, however, but also about the political choices they make. Ardern has used the crisis in New Zealand to unite her country in the face of attack. She has not approached the tragedy as leader of the Labour party but as leader of the nation, with the duty to bind it together and heal it. May occasionally makes a nod to the need to unite an unprecedentedly divided United Kingdom, as she did incongruously in her speech attacking MPs last week. But whenever confronted by a political choice she has put the unity of the Conservative party above that of the nation. She has invariably pandered to the ERG and its extremist views rather than trying to build a cross-party consensus among moderates in parliament.

And lastly there is the personality of the leader. Ardern, even in the darkest of days, has managed to introduce a sense of optimism about the future despite the horror of the attacks. May seems to be able to render everything depressing. For her, there are no sunny uplands but just another spoonful of castor oil. We are not doing Brexit because it improves the country but just because we must.

Economic and social forces are fundamental in driving history, notably the pent-up anger built on depressed wages and shrinking opportunities that led many to vote for Brexit. But leaders matter too. If the United Kingdom had been led by Ardern we might still have had Brexit, but we would not have ended up with this national humiliation, a divided society and an imperilled economy. If May had been prime minister of New Zealand at her robotic worst, God knows what would have happened after the massacres.

## 139, Winston Peters invokes Christchurch massacre as NZ's deportations row with Australia escalates

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/winston-peters-christchurch-australia-massacre-as-new-zealand-deportation-row-escalates

> New Zealand’s deputy PM hits back at Peter Dutton, accusing him of putting his leadership ambitions ahead of trans-Tasman relationship

Winston Peters has invoked the tragedy of the Christchurch massacre in blasting Australia’s policy of forced deportations of non-citizens, saying an Australian was charged with “the worst tragedy we’ve ever had”, and nobody “sought to abuse Australia about that”.

New Zealand’s deputy prime minister on Tuesday escalated Jacinda Ardern’s recent evisceration of Australia’s policy, telling the ABC the home affairs minister Peter Dutton had implemented deportations for political reasons and for personal ambition, and Australia should be “better than that”.

Peters told ABC radio that the man on trial for mass murder over the massacre had “come to this country from Australia”.

“Did we make a song and dance about Australia about that?”

“It was the worst tragedy we’ve ever had – 51 people lost their lives and scores and scores were damaged forever. It was far worse than Port Arthur, and no one in my country sought to abuse Australia about that.”

Australian Brenton Tarrant is being prosecuted for the mass shooting at two mosques in New Zealand last March. He has pleaded not guilty. The trial is due in June, and New Zealand is on high alert in the lead-up to the anniversary of the tragedy on 15 March.

Peters accused Dutton of putting short-term domestic politics, including his own leadership ambitions, above the trans-Tasman relationship. He said Australia’s policy began with politics “and we know who began it, and we know what happened when he went to run for the Liberal leadership, and he gets to the door and he knocks on it and it ends up being Scott Morrison, not Mr Dutton”.

“We all know the background of this, so let’s not shilly-shally around. We are both better than that.”

Forced deportations has been a point of friction in the bilateral relationship for several years, but has flared as New Zealand heads for the polls later this year. New Zealand police have said Australia’s policy is a significant factor behind a rise in domestic criminal gang activity.

Dutton said on Monday Ardern was accelerating criticism of the policy because of the looming election, and that was “regrettable”.

“New Zealand obviously is in an electoral cycle at the moment,” he told Sky News on Monday. “It is, I think, regrettable that she made the comments but that would have played well domestically for her.”

Peters rejected the commentary. He said the complaint from New Zealand was not about the election. “He’s wrong,” he said. Local police had raised the negative consequences of deportations of violent criminals because there was evidence of a growing problem. “We wouldn’t be saying it unless we had evidence.”

Peters argued Australia’s policy was fundamentally unfair: “You’ve sent thousands back to New Zealand and we’ve sent a handful back to you.”

He said Australia needed friends in the world and so did New Zealand. Australia asserted it had the right to deport citizens of other countries, but the conversation should be about fairness and about respect between two like-minded countries that had been allies for a couple of centuries.

During a visit to Australia last week, Ardern took her strongest stance yet opposing Australia’s policy of deporting New Zealand citizens, no matter how long they had spent in Australia, if they had committed a crime.

Standing next to Scott Morrison in Sydney, Ardern said: “You have deported more than 2,000 individuals, and among them will be genuine Kiwis who do need to learn the consequences of their actions.

“But among those 2,000 are individuals who are too young to become criminals on our watch, they were too young to become patched gang members, too young to be organised criminals.

“We will own our people. We ask that Australia stops exporting theirs.”

Morrison said Australia had no plans to abandon the policy. “The Australian government’s policy is very clear,” he said. “We deport non-citizens who have committed crimes in Australia against our community.

“This policy is applied not specific to one country, but to any country whose citizens are here. You commit a crime here, if convicted, once you have done your time, we send you home.”

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/08/new-zealand-must-address-past-failures-to-restore-muslims-sense-of-safety-and-belonging

> Following the release of the Christchurch shooting report, the government has to prove to the Islamic community it takes accountability seriously

By the time I reach my 62nd birthday, I will finally be able to find out what happened in the lead-up to 15 March 2019. That’s because the majority of evidence collected throughout the royal commission of inquiry into the Christchurch mosque attacks will be suppressed for 30 years.

In fact, the government ministers, police, immigration and intelligence officials questioned throughout the entire process have been promised they would remain anonymous – shielded from public scrutiny until the year 2050. These decisions were made by the commission to protect confidentiality and national security.

If this sounds bizarre, it absolutely is. The purpose of the inquiry was to scrutinise the role of these agencies and examine whether or not they failed to protect the Muslim community from a threat that was months, if not years, in the making.

The 800-page report was publicly released on Tuesday after a 20-month investigation. It has concluded clearly and unequivocally that the government failed to protect Muslims, and that intelligence agencies placed biased and inappropriate scrutiny on the threat of “Islamic” extremism at the cost of monitoring the rise of rightwing activity.

The report outlines 44 recommendations to government, which include reforming gun laws, recognising hate-crime offences, setting up an oversight group that includes members of the Muslim community, implementing a transparent and publicly facing counter-terror policy and establishing a new national intelligence and security agency that can adequately address the threats to New Zealand.

The findings will come as a small relief to the many Muslim voices who spent years trying desperately to highlight these points to no avail. It marks the end of an inquiry marred by criticism and frustration from the community, who often felt sidelined and shut out of key decisions, unable to pose the questions they needed answers to, or be involved in deciding the terms of reference or scope of the commission.

The inquiry also included interviews with Rebecca Kitteridge, the director general of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS), Andrew Hampton, the head of the government communications security bureau (GCSB), police commissioner Mike Bush and two of former prime minister Sir John Key’s key staff. These crucial interviews will not be made public and have been excluded from the report.

This means the individuals entrusted with keeping safe our most vulnerable communities will never have to answer publicly for the counter-terror policies that for years targeted the Muslim community. Nor the legislations passed under urgency to grant NZSIS and the GCSB sweeping powers to monitor individuals and stop them from flying overseas. Nor the questionable alleged tactics of security agents showing up at people’s doors to ask about their Facebook messages, offering cash payments to young Muslims to spy on their mosques or promising them pathways to citizenship, or the continued government and media scrutiny of a community that makes up less than 1% of the population that had no means of defending itself, neither in the public eye or in the privacy of their own mosques.

There are two individuals in particular who must be held accountable publicly: Kitteridge and Sir John.

Between 2014 and 2017, both were instrumental in shaping New Zealand’s counter-terror program, modelled closely after our Five Eyes partners in the US and Australia. In 2014, Sir John argued passionately for the need to grant intelligence bodies wider powers, and highlighted the threat of foreign fighters to New Zealand repeatedly and publicly. In 2015, he announced to media that “jihadi brides” were fleeing New Zealand’s shores to travel to Syria, a statement that later proved to be misleading. His government was accused of deliberately stoking fear and suspicion to justify passing laws under urgency. Kitteridge later reportedly apologised privately to a Muslim group (without using the phrase jihadi brides), but nothing public from her or the prime minister’s office was ever acknowledged.

In its submission to the inquiry, the Federation of the Islamic Associations of New Zealand accused the state intelligence bodies of “institutional Islamophobia”. For years its members knocked on the doors of the prime ministers’ office asking to be consulted on the legislations they knew would disproportionately impact their community. For years they went unheard.

Chillingly, in the report, they wrote: “We asked for help. We knew we were vulnerable to such an attack. We did not know who, when, what, where or how. But we knew.”

Just one month before the attacks, Kitteridge spoke to parliament’s intelligence and security committee. In a speech with close to 2,000 words focusing on the threat of Al-Qaida and Isis, only 12 were dedicated to the threat of far-right extremism: “Internationally the slow but concerning rise of rightwing extremism also continues.”

Since 15 March, a number of people have called me “prescient” for reporting on the rising rates of anti-Muslim attacks in New Zealand, the police refusal to collect hate-crime statistics, the intelligence community’s singular and obsessive focus on mosques and Muslims and their neglect of the rise of far-right activity. It was all pointing towards an inevitable catastrophe, one we as a country were ill-prepared for.

If you grew up, as I did, attending a makeshift community mosque housed in an industrial warehouse or a rented suburban flat, you were well aware of just how vulnerable you were. That there were no real fire exits. That anyone could walk through the front doors armed with ill intentions and no one could stop them.

You watched the news reports about Isis, “jihadi brides” and homegrown terrorism and you knew everyone else was watching them too. You caught the bus the following morning and felt suspicious eyes burning into your neck. You walked into work and felt the discomfort whenever a high-profile incident occurred in Sydney or Paris. You joked darkly with your Muslim friends about how NZSIS was reading your messages. You curbed your anger each time a customs officer stopped you for hours, or promised you it was just a “random search”.

The experience of being a Muslim New Zealander has meant always carrying two conflicting truths in your stomach: that you were suspicious everywhere you went, and that hidden in the tall weeds of society were people who did not want you in this country, and who intended you harm.

The justice many of us had hoped for in the royal commission was an answer to the nagging question that plagued the Muslim voices who for years were banging on the doors of government, police, customs, immigration and NZSIS: why were we ignored

Kitteridge issued an apology to the Muslim community following the report’s release, but denied that NZSIS had been spying on them. It is a bizarre claim, contradicted by years of reporting, testimonials as well as the royal commission report itself.

It will be weeks before the scope and extent of this report is grasped fully. Its findings and recommendations are a vital step forward in addressing the mistakes of the past, and the changes needed to build transparent and representative state agencies that can protect every New Zealander. However, this cannot and should not be the end of the road, and transparency cannot be shirked in favour of a clean and easy process.

The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has promised accountability and vowed to implement the recommendations in the report. But is true accountability possible if the individuals who oversaw the country’s most powerful agencies are protected from the beginning, their testimonies and actions hidden from the light?

It’s hard not to draw parallels with another investigation that was taking place over the past year into the tragic White Island volcanic eruption that killed 22 people in December 2019. Released last week, that inquiry resulted in the prosecution of 13 parties, who will each have to fight in court for the right of name suppression. So why were the individuals questioned in the royal commission promised anonymity from the beginning?

The government now has to prove to the Muslim community it takes this sense of accountability seriously. It has to answer to the survivors and victims of the mosque shooting, who have today called on the government to “reconsider” the suppression order and to answer the questions left unanswered.

The Christchurch Muslim community, on their part, have responded with grace and gratitude, as they always have. Despite all they’ve endured, they step forward with openness and goodwill, resting on their faith as a guide and as a salve. It is now on the government to respond in kind, to build on the platform of kindness and unity they’ve rightly received praise for a concrete and transparent timeline of actions – actions that address the failures of the past and restore for Muslims the sense of safety and belonging we have been missing for too long.

## 141, New Zealand abandons Labour and shifts to the right as country votes for wholesale change

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/14/new-zealand-election-2023-results-national-party-labour-

> Party once led by Jacinda Ardern suffers serious election defeat amid anger over cost of living and strict Covid policies

New Zealand voters have delivered a forceful rejection of the Labour government as a surge in support for the National party delivered what analysts described as a “bloodbath” for the government and a new right-leaning era for politics in the country.

The result marked a dramatic change in fortunes for the Labour party, which three years earlier – led by Jacinda Ardern - secured a historic mandate, but saw its support dwindle in the face of rising living costs and the Covid pandemic.

Speaking to a large crowd of party-faithful at his election night event in Auckland, National party leader Christopher Luxon said his party was on course to form the next government with libertarian party Act. “All over this country you have reached for hope and you have voted for change,” Luxon said.

Luxon pledged to bring down the cost of living, restore law and order, as well as deliver better healthcare and education. His address came shortly after Labour leader Chris Hipkins conceded that his party had lost the election. Analysts variously described the jump in support for National as a “bluenami” and “nightmare” for the government.

New Zealand’s shift to the right ends Labour’s six years in office, which coincided with the Covid-19 pandemic, the Christchurch mosque attacks and the Whakaari volcano eruption. It will firmly draw a line under Ardern’s era of politics.

More than 95% of the vote had been counted late Saturday, local time. National was predicted to gain 50 seats, and its traditional coalition party Act on 11 seats, just on the 61 seats needed to govern. With some results still to be counted, the remaining question was whether it would be forced to bring a third party – populist New Zealand First – into their governing deal.

Luxon thanked Hipkins for his time serving New Zealand as prime minister.

“I wished him well, because it is obviously a tough night for Labour.”

Speaking at an election night event in Wellington, Hipkins - who became Labour leader in January after Jacinda Ardern’s surprise resignation – said he had called the opposition leader Luxon to congratulate him on the results.

“As it stands Labour is not in a position to form another government,” he said. “The result is not one any of us wanted.”

“It was going to be an uphill battle. No government has replaced a prime minister in an election year and gone on to win.”

Acknowledging the natural disasters, terrorist attack and pandemic that marred his government’s term, Hipkins said: “I honestly think that the Gods rounded up curveballs to throw at us.”

Hipkins became emotional, thanking his family, and was met with cheers of “Chippy” – his nickname - from his supporters.

It is an extraordinary change in fortune for the party, which in 2020 – then under Ardern’s leadership – was voted into power in a landslide, giving it the biggest mandate in nearly 30 years.

But the country has revealed its mood for change in the years since that historic victory. The rising cost of living and post-pandemic malaise has translated into dissatisfaction with the political status quo, and Hipkins failed to amass the extraordinary popularity of his predecessor.

In a telling display of the country’s malaise, Labour not only bled seats to the right, but also to smaller parties on the left – the Green Party and Te Pāti Māori, which captured votes from those wanting to see greater action on climate change, transformative investment in the social security net and better outcomes for Maori.

The Green Party appear set to gain 14 seats and managed to take some of Labour’s safest seats, including Wellington Central, which has been held by Labour since 1999 and Rongotai, held since 1996.

Opinion polls in the lead up to the election had the populist minor party New Zealand First once again in the kingmaker position, and there is reasonable chance National and Act will still need them, once the special votes comes in and if there is an “overhang” from Te Pāti Māori winning some of the Māori electorate seats.

Victims of the mosque massacre


Former Australian race discrimination commissioner Tim Soutphommasane, has called on the Australian media to “wake up” and evaluate the way it covers far-right views.

Soutphommasane tweeted a video from breakfast television show Sunrise, in which host David Koch asked Senator Pauline Hanson whether she felt complicit in the Christchurch shootings. Hanson disputed this and then argued Australia had lost its identity, Australian people lived in fear of terrorism and warned that Australia not become like the UK, France and Sweden.

Wake up, Australian media. Giving hate-mongers helped create the conditions for this atrocity to take place. You can scrutinise far-right extremists without giving them yet more free air to spread their hate. Stop being complicit https://t.co/xodIXj70qL

The first funerals of those killed in Friday’s shootings are expected to be held today, the ABC are reporting.

New Zealand immigration authorities have said they will fast-track visa applications for the families of people killed or injured in the Christchurch mosque massacre.

Immigration New Zealand’s Steve McGill said he wanted to make things as easy as possible for people to lay their loved ones to rest or support family members injured in the mass shooting on Friday.

“These are unprecedented circumstances for everyone and INZ is committed to ensuring we do everything we can to support those who have been affected and make the visa application process as smooth as possible,” he said on Monday.

Relatives are planning funerals for those killed in the terror attack, with Islamic tradition dictating that bodies be buried as soon as possible after death.

Authorities expect to be able to release all the bodies to their families by Wednesday.

Immigration authorities are also working through possible options for people on temporary visas who have been affected by the attack.

Penny Wong, Australia’s shadow minister for foreign affairs, gave a speech lat night at the vigil for the victims of the Christchurch shooting at Marion mosque at Park Holme, near Adelaide.

The full text of the speech is here:

We gather here tonight in a time of great sorrow and a time of great sadness.

We gather to mourn the tragic and senseless murder of fifty people – mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters – Attacked in their place of worship as they came together for Friday prayers, a sacred time.

We gather to show compassion and support to friends and families of those lost, and all those injured and recovering.

We gather in solidarity with the people of New Zealand and with the Muslim community, the Muslim peoples everywhere.

On Friday we saw horrific acts of violence. They were acts of terrorism, and at their core, they were acts of hatred. This terrorist was welcomed into the Mosque as a brother and he responded with hate, and with bullets.

He is an extremist, right-wing, violent terrorist but most of all he does not represent Australian values. He is not who we are.

So to the Muslim community here and across this nation, we know that you are experiencing great pain and sorrow and we stand with you. We abhor these acts of extremist violence.

We reject the extreme right-wing ideology, the hatred and the intolerance, that led to these acts of extremist violence. But most importantly we reject hatred in all its forms.

Together we stand for Australian values of inclusion, acceptance and respect; a belief in equality; the rejection of racism; the rejection of prejudice; the rejection of division. These are the values of our Australia and this is the nation in which we have faith.

We have seen some shameful comments by a Senator, who I will not name, a shameful and pathetic attempt by a man who has never been elected, to get attention by exploiting our diversity as a fault line for political advantage.

This Senator does not speak for us. He does not speak for Australia and he does not represent Australian values but he does do one thing, he reminds us how important it is that we all stand together united against hatred.

Leaders – political, community, religious, all of us – stand united against hatred. Because we saw tragically in the loss of life on Friday where hatred leads us.

We here today know these truths. We know that a nation that is divided is never stronger. We know that making others lesser, fanning prejudice and discrimination, has never made a nation safer. We know that no group within our society is immune from the effects of hatred.

And we know it is the responsibility of all of us to stand against hatred in all its forms, and embrace tolerance, acceptance and honour our shared humanity.

In the aftermath of Friday’s attacks, the Imam Hasan Centre issued a statement and I believe the sentiments deserve reflection tonight.

“It is times like this that we lose hope and doubt humanity, when people of faith come under attack in such a way, it shows us how low humanity can fall. However, it never ceases to amaze how far humanity can rise after such despicable events”.

“United as a community, we can overcome these barbaric events wherever they happen. Divided we become barbaric ourselves and the innocent lives lost around the world should be a sign for us to unite against hate.”

So now friends, this is the time to show those who seek to divide us just how far humanity can rise.

To the people of New Zealand, and in particular the New Zealand Islamic community, your Australian family grieves with you. Like you we mourn the tragic and senseless loss of life. We stand with you in this time of sorrow and sadness and we commit to stand against hatred in all its forms.

And by being here tonight it is an act by all of you, an act of faith, to demonstrate that we work together towards a society where all are welcome, where all may live in peace and security.

Because we here tonight know that respect and hope are greater than fear, and that love is greater than hate.

Christchurch locals are returning to work today after a weekend reeling from the shootings on Friday. One local, Marianne Mccormick described her journey as she rode past the Botanical Gardens, near Al Noor mosque, one of the sights of the shooting, on the her way to work and described what she saw.

“I rode my bike to work this morning and went past the thousands of flowers and messages, I stopped my bike and walked past it all slowly and wanted to cry, it makes me so emotional, it makes the whole city emotional.”

She also said the helicopters haven’t stopped since the attacks and that is all that Christchurch locals can hear at night.

The organisers of New Zealand’s largest gun show say they have cancelled the event to show respect for victims of the Christchurch massacre and because of “elevated security risks”.

Jacinda Ardern vowed to tighten gun laws after the attack and the New Zealand cabinet are currently meeting to discuss changes to the legislation. She says banning private ownership of semi-automatic rifles, which were used to devastating effect in Friday’s attack on two Christchurch mosques, is an option.

The Kumeu Militaria Show, near Auckland, has been held for about five years.

In a statement announcing cancellation of the 23 March event, organisers say the show aims to support servicemen and women and promote interest in New Zealand’s military history.

Jacinda Ardern has spoken with British prime minister Theresa May, who offered New Zealand any assistance needed in the wake of Friday’s shootings.

“The leaders discussed the swift and exemplary response of New Zealand’s security and health services and the numerous acts of bravery carried out by police and other first responders,” a spokesperson for May said in a statement.

Meanwhile in Manchester in the UK, two people have been charged, after a taxi driver was subjected to abuse and threats that referenced the New Zealand terrorist attacks.

Natalie Rudman, 34, and Sean Allen, 33, have been charged with a section 4 racially aggravated public order offence.

They have been bailed to appear at Manchester magistrates court on 9 April.

Shortly before 12.20am on 17 Sunday March, police were called to Queensway, Rochdale, following a report that passengers had referenced the New Zealand terrorist attacks while abusing and threatening a taxi driver.

New Zealand’s cabinet are meeting this morning to begin work to change gun laws.

Prime minster Jacinda Ardern said on Sunday that gun regulation would be discussed at Monday’s cabinet meeting, telling reporters: “We cannot be deterred from the work we need to do on our gun laws in New Zealand. They need to change.”

It is alleged that the suspect in the attack, Australian Brenton Tarrant, had a firearms licence and five guns.

Civilians in New Zealand own an estimated 1.2m firearms, making the country’s per capita rate of gun ownership higher than Australia’s, but still far below the US.

Good morning and welcome to our live coverage as New Zealand continues to reel from Friday’s deadly attack in Christchurch.

Australian police said they had executed two search warrants in towns on the New South Wales mid-north coast related to the investigation into Friday’s mass shootings at mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch.

Police said that at around 8:30 am on Monday a search warrant was executed by the New South Wales Joint Counter Terrorism Team (JCTT) at a home in the town of Sandy Beach, near Coffs Harbour, and shortly after another warrant was executed at a home in Lawrence, near Maclean.

“The primary aim of the activity is to formally obtain material that may assist New Zealand Police in their ongoing investigation,” the Australian federal police and NSW police said in a joint statement.

They said the family of the Australian man arrested in Christchurch were assisting police.

“The community can be assured that there is no information to suggest a current or impending threat related to the search warrants,” the statement said.

## 144, Christchurch attack: police 'warned about specific threat planned for day of shootings'

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/06/christchurch-attack-police-warned-about-specific-threat-planned-for-day-of-shootings

> Evidence to inquiry says officers should have been stationed outside mosques on day of massacre

Police in New Zealand were warned about a specific threat to mosques in the country planned for the day that a gunman stormed two places of worship in Christchurch during Friday prayers and killed 51 people, according to evidence given to a closed-door inquiry into whether the attack could have been prevented.

The threat, which appeared on Facebook, to burn a Qur’an outside a New Zealand mosque on 15 March 2019 did not appear to be made by the man guilty of the attacks, the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand (IWCNZ) said in its submission to the royal commission into the attack. But the IWCNZ told the panel the police should have been stationed outside mosques that day and that the attack might have been slowed or prevented if they had.

While the group has spoken before about its efforts to raise fears about safety with New Zealand’s government, this is the first time a claim has emerged that the police were told of a separate white supremacist incident planned for the same day as the terrorist attack.

The police had “failed in not developing a national strategy to deal with threats against Muslims and mosques”, the IWCNZ said, and when one of the its members had reported the 15 March threat, the police had initially “dismissed the matter” until she insisted it be followed up.“If there had been such a strategy, then the message would have alerted every mosque in the country to a threat to one mosque on Friday 15 March 2019 and for all mosques to take extra security measures,” the submission says.

The submission, which the Guardian has read in full, lays out how the group desperately tried to raise concerns about the growing threat of far-right white supremacy to the highest levels of government between 2015 and 2019.

Instead, it was ignored, said the IWCNZ, told it was wrong, or was not taken seriously by public servants who sometimes stopped communicating with the council, did not follow up on promised action, or did not keep records of their meetings.

An Australian man who had been radicalised online and amassed a stash of weapons carried out the Christchurch attack – the deadliest shootings in modern New Zealand history – which he broadcast live on Facebook.

The Police said in a statement that it was inappropriate to comment on any submission to the Commission, as it had not concluded. The statement, which was not attributed to a named spokesperson, said officers had identified and formally warned the person who made the threat against mosques in 2019.

The independent inquiry into the shooting is due to report back to New Zealand’s government at the end of July , after which the government will be responsible for releasing the panel’s findings. However, the IWCNZ has chosen to make its submission public ahead of time.

“They’d done everything right, in terms of going to the highest possible people in government,” said Frances Joychild, a lawyer representing the council at the inquiry. “They did all the right things, and the extraordinary thing is that nothing happened.”

Joychild, who has represented claimants in cases against the government for a decade, said she was “sickened” by the way public servants had not heeded the council’s pleas for security.

“They could see a fire about to happen and we had this huge, incompetent inert public service,” she said, adding that there was no way government agencies “could say they didn’t know” about the risk to Muslims in New Zealand. “They did know, they just didn’t care.”

The IWCNZ was represented by three of its leaders – Aliya Danzeisen, Anjum Rahman, and Maysoon Salama, whose son was killed in the attacks. Across hundreds of pages of submissions, the council told the inquiry about the meetings, emails, and exhortations it had made to successive governments.

The trio paid for their own flights and accommodation on trips to New Zealand’s capital to meet MPs and officials, it said, giving presentation after presentation about issues affecting Muslim women, which had included a broad range of matters, until a rising global tide of white supremacy arrived at New Zealand’s shores.

Then, the women said, their entreaties about what they called the “alt-right” grew more urgent. They had solicited meetings with the head of New Zealand’s spy agency and with the country’s minister in charge of the security services, warning that Muslims were being profiled at the expense of the far-right.

They had called for a national strategy to protect the Muslim community, a Muslim advisory group to government agencies, and funding for their work.

“Yet almost nothing was in place by the time of the mosque shootings,” they said in the submission. The group now wants the government to pass hate speech laws, issue an apology to the council and commit to reparations to victims and bereaved families.

The royal commission investigating the attacks has been approached for comment. It was initially due to report back to New Zealand’s government in December 2019, after the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, promised answers by the end of the year about whether the attack could have been prevented. An April deadline was later pushed to the end of July because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

A spokesman for Ardern said it would be inappropriate for her to comment on the IWCNZ’s submission until the commission had released its full findings.

Brenton Tarrant, the man who pleaded guilty to 51 murders and a terrorism charge, is due to be sentenced at a lengthy hearing in August. He faces life in prison.

## 145, Christchurch attacks: the media's rush to be first causes its own kind of harm

https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2019/mar/24/christchurch-attacks-the-medias-rush-to-be-first-causes-its-own-kind-of-harm

> Facebook’s AI may have failed the victims – but humans didn’t do much better

Rookie journalists struggling with their copy are often told by news editors: “Just tell the story”. An esteemed colleague once told me his first editor told him to imagine shouting the intro to an aged relative moving away at speed on a bus.

Boiling an event down to who, what, why, where and when is the basis of all news coverage for a reason – it tells the story. But what happens when being fast and crafting a simple narrative becomes misleading or causes its own kind of harm?

This question has become increasingly relevant over the past decade. The internet has brought incredible new ways of telling stories. But it has also made being first and most furious seem like the best way to triumph in a fiercely competitive market.

Two entirely separate events last week made it clear that the media needs urgently to adapt the way it conveys information and carries out its business.

The recent terror attack in Christchurch, which allowed an online audience to watch a massacre through the eyes of the killer as though it were a live action movie, and a mundane meeting between a domestic homicide campaign group and a media regulator might not appear to have much in common. Yet both show us that it is in the treatment of victims that the media is most likely to cause offence and most likely to get it wrong: the first through the overexcited use of new technology and the second because of base assumptions.

Much has been written about the Christchurch gunman’s use of Facebook livestream, a technology which allows us all – including mass murderers – to become video broadcasters. But there are still lessons to be learned about the way the incident was dealt with by media. There were 1.5m attempts to re-upload the video to Facebook after it was first taken down, about a fifth of which were successful.

One version of the video monitored by the Guardian was left live on Facebook for at least six hours, while others were available on YouTube for at least three. More inexplicably, given traditional media’s often justifiable outrage at the behaviour of online platforms, several TV news channels, including Sky Australia and newspaper websites including Mail Online, the Mirror and the Sun in the UK also hosted edited videos of the same footage, only taking it down hours later.

The whole sorry saga suggests the limits of AI, one of the technologies relied on by Facebook to arbitrate between right and wrong. A man Facebook billed as “head of integrity” admitted that “this particular video did not trigger our automatic detection systems”. He explained that the attacker’s live stream had not been taken down as quickly as it could have because it was not flagged by users as a video of suicide.

It was at least an improvement on the usual Facebook stance of suggesting that there is just too much stuff to proactively do anything about.

The failings of social media sites and particularly Facebook are not new, and newspapers crushed by the assault on their revenues have, in the main, led the criticism. So it seems particularly perverse that newspapers themselves acted as platforms for the gunman’s sick footage. If humans are to claim the moral high ground in the way they report stories, they must make better decisions than machines.

This is not just about the actions of certain sections of the press, but about all those who provide news. Journalists writing the first draft of history are hard-wired to want to tell the story in as exciting a way as possible. For many, being asked to stop and think of the consequences smacks of heavy-handed outside control, an affront to the principle that news is what somebody does not want you to print.

And yet. New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has let her response be guided by research suggesting that murderers act partly out of a desire for publicity, ruling out using the attacker’s name. Dan Hett, the software engineer brother of one of the victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena attack, blames online content for radicalising young men. So too does Neil Basu, Britain’s counter-terrorism chief, who last week said that far-right terrorists are being radicalised by mainstream newspaper coverage.

Newspapers may rail against police interference in their content but linking to the gunman’s 72-page “manifesto”, as Mail Online did, or describing him as an “angelic boy” and sticking a huge picture of the killer as a blond toddler on the front page (making him look like, what, “one of us”?), as the Mirror did, feeds into a narrative in which the killer becomes the star of the show.

This narrative was at the heart of the second event of last week, a meeting between the feminist campaign group Level Up and the press regulator Ipso, which is to host the group’s material on its guidance to journalists and editors page.

Terror attacks, so random and wicked, may seem like an increasingly prominent feature of modern life, but far more consistent over the years is the killing of women by their partners. Two women on average die every week at the hand of a partner or ex-partner in the UK.

Unlike the narratives used to explain terror, the simple story most often relied on with these murders is that they are “crimes of passion” in which “jealous lovers” act in a rage. Research by Jane Monckton-Smith suggests that the use of such “romantic language” in domestic abuse deaths leads to lighter sentencing in court. He just couldn’t help it, you see: he was driven mad by jealousy and love.

The usual victims in these cases are of course dead – but their grieving families have started to call out these misleading narratives. Luke and Ryan Hart wrote a book about their experience after their father killed their mother and sister. The shooting, in a car park in Spalding, was so horrific that at first local news reports feared a terror attack. The brothers were moved to campaign on press coverage of victims when they realised that the “story” was one in which their controlling, abusive father simply became a “DIY nut” and “nice guy” who was “driven” to murder because of the threat of divorce.

These two types of crime – one so public, one so very close to home – are at the forefront of demands on today’s news media. Yet most of those speaking out about them come from the political or policing spheres, which is wrong. Nobody wants freedom of speech to be curtailed, yet media organisations have a duty to speak up.

Ipso tells me that both domestic homicide and major incidents are its top priorities for reporting guidelines this year. Discussions so far have focused on whether guidelines can be integrated into the editors’ code in the same way that those around suicide have been.

Time-pressed and under pressure, many journalists will never read this advice fully, so here’s a summary.

First, never publish inaccurate or misleading information. For example, there were no gunshots or lorries being driven into people on Oxford Street in 2017, as erroneously reported at the time. Next, don’t oversimplify. We want to understand how human beings can carry out evil deeds. But think about the victims and don’t rush to explain.

The last page of the guidelines devised by Level Up says simply: “The murder may initially seem to come from ‘nowhere’, but a closer look may tell another story.” Anyone who has worked in a newsroom – as opposed to politicians, the police and campaigners – will know that breaking news doesn’t allow for a “closer look”.

That makes it vital to tell the story, but without reaching for the easiest method of doing it first.

## 146, Jacinda Ardern says Christchurch trial should not be platform for hate

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/06/jacinda-ardern-says-christchurch-trial-should-not-be-platform-for-hate

>  New Zealand PM says she hopes artificial intelligence may one day stop attacks being live streamed

Jacinda Ardern has said she will do all she can to stop a man accused of killing 51 Muslim worshippers from spreading his message of hate at his trial, and hopes artificial intelligence will one day stop such attacks from being broadcast online.

Ardern said in an interview with the Associated Press that she thought Brenton Tarrant, who has been charged with 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one count of terrorism over the 15 March attack, would try to use his trial starting in June to promote his views.

“It’s clear that a part of this individual’s motivation is creating a platform for himself. I think that’s absolutely clear,” she said.

“And I think every opportunity we can to deprive the alleged terrorist of that should be utilised.”

Ardern said she was limited in what she could do but was encouraged by the pledge of New Zealand’s major media outlets to avoid promoting white supremacist ideology when covering the trial.

Ardern said she stood by her decision to never speak the alleged gunman’s name.

“If someone’s motivated by infamy, then you deprive them of it,” she said.

The attack on the mosques was livestreamed on Facebook. Ardern said she hoped artificial intelligence could be used to stop future attacks from being broadcast, and that everybody had a responsibility to prevent such broadcasts from continuing to happen.

“Even Facebook have made moves around the way that they utilise livestreaming and who can access it,” she said. “In the future, I believe we can actually use AI technology increasingly.”

Ardern said she was traveling in a van on the outskirts of the North Island town of New Plymouth when she first heard about the attacks.

“The scale of it and the magnitude of it took some time to come to grips with,” she said.

Farid Ahmed, whose wife Husna was killed in the attack on the Noor mosque, said New Zealanders were initially confused about what to think. But a week later at Muslim prayers in Christchurch, Ardern gave a nationally televised speech that Ahmed said united people with three simple words: “We are one.”

“It was so beautiful, in just one sentence,” Ahmed said.

Ardern said she still had the piece of paper where she’d hurriedly written her sentiments after the attack, words that would later resonate around the world.

“To me, it should have been the most unextraordinary thing to say. It was just my instinct around the way New Zealanders would be feeling,” she said. “Yes, this was an attack, very explicitly on our Muslim community. But they were our Muslim community. I just felt that needed to be said straight away.”

Ardern said nobody at the time was really analysing what they were doing or saying, they were just responding, often with great compassion. She said everybody felt emotional at the time but she couldn’t let that get in the way of doing her job.

“I did the best I could at making sure that I didn’t let anyone down. I needed to keep going and keep focused and keep working on behalf of those families,” she said. “But yeah, of course, undeniably it had an impact on me.”

Ardern vowed to change New Zealand’s gun laws after the attacks, and less than a month later all but one of the country’s 120 lawmakers voted in favour of banning assault weapons.

“In my view, we are just total pragmatists,” Ardern said. “So when we saw the scale, and magnitude, and impact of these types of weapons utilised in this way, even those who legitimately hold weapons, said: ‘Actually, we don’t need those. Those don’t need to stay.’”

A gun-buyback scheme that ends later this month has seen 37,000 newly banned weapons turned over to police, although some estimates indicate there could be many thousands of banned guns that haven’t been turned in. Ardern said she felt the buyback had been a success.

“Those are tens of thousands of guns that are no longer in circulation,” she said. “And that is a good thing.”

In a speech after the attacks, Ahmed told a crowd of about 20,000 people in Christchurch that he forgave the man who killed his wife. He said he didn’t want to have a heart burning with anger and hatred.

Ardern said Ahmed was an extraordinary man. Asked if she could ever forgive the gunman, Ardern turned the focus back on those who were at the mosques.

“No one is more central to what happened on the 15th of March than those who were directly affected,” Ardern said. “So it’s not for me to give.”

## 147, 'Remain resolute': Christchurch students' haka tribute has roots in earthquake

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/22/remain-resolute-christchurch-students-haka-tribute-has-roots-in-earthquake

> Ancient Tahu Pōtiki ceremonial dance was also used to mourn victims of 2011 disaster 

Moving video of school students in Christchurch performing the haka at a memorial for 50 people killed in Friday’s massacre has its roots in another recent tragedy.

The Tahu Pōtiki haka is specific to Te Waipounamu, New Zealand’s South Island. It has an ancient history but became widely used in Christchurch following the 2011 earthquakes as a way to help the community, and particularly school students, cope with a disaster that killed 185 people.

Now it is being used to show respect for those affected by another traumatic event.

Angus Hikairo Macfarlane, professor of Maori research at the University of Canterbury, said the use of culturally inclusive practices made Christchurch a more resilient city.

“Ngai Tahu is the local iwi (tribe) with a proud tradition of being resolute in the face of extremities in life and when the haka is performed within the tribal area this resoluteness is portrayed not only in the lyrics but in the movements, expressions, and the kotahitanga (unity),” Macfarlane said. “School groups have mastered this performance.”

The first line, “Otautahi, Maraka Maraka,” is a rallying call for Christchurch to rise up and remain resolute.

On Monday, a students from several local schools performed an impromptu haka at a memorial site for the victims of the mosque terrorist attack, which included a number of their classmates.

On Wednesday students at Cashmere high school, who lost two of their numbers in the massacre, performed the haka in welcome for prime minister Jacinda Ardern.

Te Hurinui Clarke, a senior lecturer at the university, said Tahu Pōtiki was named for and celebrated the ancestor of Ngai Tahu.

“It is used in this area instead of the more widely seen haka Ka Mate for historical reasons,” he said. “Tahu Pōtiki as with many other haka can be used for a number of purposes such as celebration, acknowledging unity, raising awareness about important issues and in times of sadness.”

## 148, Christchurch changes the dynamics of the next Australian election irrevocably

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2019/mar/26/christchurch-changes-the-dynamics-of-the-next-australian-election-irrevocably

> The mosque attack demands a level of collective empathy that renders a divisive medevac fear campaign counterproductive

It was two nights before the massacre of 50 worshippers in a Christchurch mosque, and the focus group of swinging voters in suburban Brisbane that I was watching scratched its collective head.

Asked to identify which politicians were responsible for a series of incendiary public comments around recently passed medical evacuation (medevac) laws, they were sure they had been asked a trick question.

The propositions included the following: that the people “coming in” are paedophiles, they will clog up our hospital queues, they will end up in cultural bubbles, that western values are sacrosanct.

It was clear to the group that this was all just more divisive, racially charged rhetoric from One Nation. Except it wasn’t.

I was in the field because conflating medevac with border security was emerging as the Coalition’s last throw of the electoral dice. The moment the bill passed through the hung parliament into law, the prime minister had begun germinating these seeds of division.

The response of the Brisbaneites was instructive. While there were pockets of support for some of the propositions put forward, there was genuine shock and some dismay when it was discovered the statements came not from the radical fringe, but from the mouths of the prime minister and his senior government ministers.

And that was before the Christchurch mosque attack.

Make no mistake; the events of the past fortnight change the dynamics of the upcoming federal election irrevocably.

Just as the 9/11 attacks on New York were an external shock that had a profound impact on the 2001 border security narrative in validating the fears that the Howard government had been fomenting, so the Christchurch massacre demands a level of collective empathy that renders a divisive medevac fear campaign profoundly counterproductive.

Under pressure over the politicisation of race, Scott Morrison must keep the dog whistle in his pocket. Confecting fear around the plight of a group of wretched asylum seekers is no longer tenable.

Indeed, the focus has now shifted on to his willingness to recommend to Australian voters put One Nation ahead of Labor and the Greens in upcoming contests. After appropriating their rhetoric, now he needs to decide whether he is prepared to appropriate their votes as well.

In a sign of our PM’s diminished standing, this week’s Essential Report suggests if Jacinda Ardern had the inclination to change nationality, she could waltz into office in Australia with an approval rating north of 70%.

In contrast, Morrison is struggling to come to terms with his recent history, just as the nation he currently leads seeks to come to terms with theirs, as a series of questions in this week’s Essential Report clearly illustrate.

Because this was an extraordinary event we can’t benchmark these results, but what they indicate is that what may have been a fertile ground for a political wedge no longer exists.

The vast majority of Australians are ready to call out white extremism as being every bit as dangerous as the Muslim fundamentalism that we have been conditioned to fear. They are also ready to back claims to hold social media platforms, the media and our politicians to account for the impact of their respective business models. While seeing the attack as an “isolated act of evil”, a significant minority seem prepared to call out racism and Islamophobia in everyday life.

Politically, all the Coalition has left in the bank now is next week’s budget when they will confect a surplus and splash around some tax cuts while decrying Labor’s attempt to dismantle tax loopholes for the well-off as proof they are high-taxing economic wreckers.

Inevitably the performance will be a tad gauche and a little desperate but, looking at the alternative, it is a debate we should all embrace with enthusiasm.

As we now know, the alternative would have been so much more dangerous.

## 149, New Zealand has put its faith in Labour: now the party must deliver

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/18/new-zealand-has-put-its-faith-in-labour-now-the-party-must-deliver

> With its most resounding victory since 1946, the weight of expectation on Labour has never been greater

The Jacinda Ardern-led New Zealand Labour party has swept to its largest election night victory since 1946, winning 49.1% of the party vote and 64 seats in parliament. While the outcome is, in effect, a little-change election in the sense that the next government will still be led by Ardern, Labour’s victory is one for the history books. Not since the introduction of New Zealand’s Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) electoral system, has the Labour party had a mandate to govern alone.

For Labour’s former coalition partner, New Zealand First, the result was a disaster. It appears minor-party voters were no longer attracted to New Zealand First’s promises to be a handbrake on change, preferring instead to give their vote to ACT and the Greens, two parties with strong ideas about how to deal with the issues that are confronting New Zealand in the immediate future: rising house prices, income and social inequality, climate change, and the post-Covid economic recovery.

ACT ended election night on a staggering 8% of the party vote, up from 0.5% in 2017. The Greens ended the night on a respectable 7.6%, up from 6.3% in 2017. Both minor parties will keep the pressure on Labour to be the transformational government it failed to be in its first term.

As will the revived Māori party. It scored an election-night upset, winning back the Māori seat of Waiariki from the incumbent Labour candidate, and potentially propelling one Māori MP back into the House. The Māori party will have a nervous wait for the special votes (expected to be over half a million nationwide) to be counted before it can celebrate. But once again a strong and independent Māori voice is likely to be heard in parliament promoting the interests of Māori, by Māori, for Māori.

For the major opposition party, National, last night’s 26.8% party vote represented its worst result since 2002. Given that the latest public opinion polls had been forecasting it landing on 31%, the drop to 27% would have been a major punch in the gut for the leader Judith Collins, the party and its followers.

It’s hard to remember back to pre-pandemic New Zealand politics, but eight months ago National was actually leading Labour in the polls. In February this year National was sitting on 46% support, with Labour at 41%. Labour’s May 2019 budget had not gone down well. Its broken election promises on KiwiBuild houses were a constant embarrassment to the party. Not even Ardern’s handling of the Christchurch mosque terrorist shootings 11 months earlier had resulted in a long-lasting poll improvement.

National will have entered this election year feeling pleased at how little it had dropped in people’s estimation since the 2017 general election, despite its former popular leadership triumvirate of John Key, Bill English and Steven Joyce having retired, and (then) new leader Simon Bridges still getting the hang of his training wheels. The last thing it would have anticipated was for its vote to be almost halved not eight months later.

And then came the pandemic, and the world as we knew it changed. It was Ardern’s making as a prime minister.

The Christchurch mosque shootings, the Whakaari White Island volcanic eruption. It turns out they were a dress rehearsal for the job of leading New Zealand through Covid-19. Closing borders, adopting an elimination strategy, shutting down parts of the economy in different alert levels. New Zealanders literally trusted Ardern with their lives, and for the most part her government delivered, leading the country to have one of the lowest rates of infection and Covid-related deaths in the world. Today most of us can go about our daily lives without worrying we will spread or catch the virus.

If Ardern rose to the challenge presented by Covid-19, the National party floundered. With no playbook for leading an opposition in a pandemic, National leaders Bridges, then Todd Muller, then Collins simply could not work out how to counter Ardern’s popularity or give voters any real reason to change. National’s main election offerings – job creation, infrastructure spending and support for small business – were not too dissimilar to Labour’s.

In the past, National has relied on the prospects of a tax rise to scare voters away from Labour. It tried to run this line again in 2020. Ardern quickly stopped it at the pass and ruled out adopting the wealth tax the Green party were proposing. Labour is still proposing an income tax rise for those earning over $180,000 a year, but this did not deter voters who know that something has to be done to curb rising income inequality, and who see a tax on the rich as part of the solution.

National will now need to take time out to regroup. Because National didn’t technically “lose” the 2017 election (when it won 44.4% of the party vote to Labour’s 36.9%) it hasn’t yet gone through the blood-letting and renewal phase required before voters decide to return their support to it. Expect lots of change in leadership and direction over the next 18 months.

Labour’s election night euphoria will not last long. Never before has there been such a weight of expectation on it to deliver for, in Ardern’s words in her victory speech, “all New Zealanders”. All eyes will also be on Ardern as she decides whether to go into some arrangement with the Greens. Labour doesn’t need them to form a government, but may consider it better to keep them inside the tent than out, so it can return to managing the economic recovery without having to be pestered by disgruntled noises coming from a former “frenemy” on the left.

## 150, Christchurch shows how social media sites help spread the poison of far-right ideology

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/24/christchurch-shows-how-social-media-sites-help-spread-poison-far-right-ideology-youtube-facebook

> The atrocity in New Zealand was carried out by a man fully aware of the power of the internet

The aftermath of the Christchurch atrocity brought significant media coverage of the attempts made by the tech companies, especially Facebook and YouTube, to take down the alleged killer’s video livestream and his so-called manifesto. These narratives had two subtexts. The first was to impress us with the sheer scale of the task. The second was implicitly to convey the public-spirited dedication of the engineers who worked around the clock to keep these obscenities from infecting the public sphere.

It would be churlish to downplay the scale of the challenge the companies faced, for it was indeed huge. Facebook for example, dealt with 1.5m uploads of the video within 24 hours and claimed to have caught 1.2m of them before they made it into users’ newsfeeds. (That still left 300,000 copies on the loose, though.)

For its part, YouTube found itself on the receiving end of a torrent of video uploads. In order to deal with the volume, the chief product officer, Neal Mohan, took the decision to override YouTube’s content moderation systems, doing away with human moderators entirely and relying on AI software to immediately identify the most violent parts of the video and autonomously block them. Predictably, this was only partially successful.

There is, however, another way of reading these heroic narratives. The huge numbers are a reminder of the colossal scale at which surveillance capitalism now operates. And the narratives conveniently obscure the fact that the companies’ formidable capability for global dissemination of uploaded content is, as programmers say, a feature, not a bug: it’s what their systems are designed to do. They enable users to publish whatever they like and to monetise the resulting data trails and “engagement”. It’s obviously a nuisance when some of the uploaded content comes from white supremacist fanatics, but – hey – that’s just the cost of doing the business that surveillance capitalists are in.

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, displayed an impressive understanding of the social media strategy of the attacker. Her remedy was to deny him what Margaret Thatcher once called “the oxygen of publicity” by refusing even to utter his name. This is smart because the killer had modelled himself on the Norwegian white supremacist Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in 2011. “Mr Breivik wanted fame,” writes his biographer in the New York Times. “He wanted his 1,500-page cut-and-paste manifesto to be read widely and he wanted a stage – his trial in Oslo. He called the bomb he set off outside the prime minister’s office in Oslo, and the massacre he carried out on the island of Utøya, his ‘book launch’.”

It looks as though the Christchurch killer had the same idea, except that he was more internet-savvy than Breivik. He displayed a mastery of neo-Nazi internet memes, for example: one of the things that struck Kevin Roose, the New York Times technology reporter, was “how unmistakably online the violence was and how aware the shooter on the video stream appears to have been about how his act would be viewed and interpreted by distinct internet subcultures. In some ways, it felt like a first – an internet-native mass shooting, conceived and produced entirely within the irony-soaked discourse of modern extremism.”

The most worrying thought that comes from immersion in accounts of the tech companies’ struggle against the deluge of uploads is not so much that murderous fanatics seek publicity and notoriety from livestreaming their atrocities on the internet, but that astonishing numbers of other people are not just receptive to their messages, but seem determined to boost and amplify their impact by “sharing” them.

And not just sharing them in the sense of pressing the “share” button. What YouTube engineers found was that the deluge contained lots of copies and clips of the Christchurch video that had been deliberately tweaked so that they would not be detected by the company’s AI systems. A simple way of doing this, it turned out, was to upload a video recording of a computer screen taken from an angle. The content comes over loud and clear, but the automated filter doesn’t recognise it.

That there are perhaps tens – perhaps hundreds – of thousands of people across the world who will do this kind of thing is a really scary discovery. The days are ending when white supremacist and neo-Nazi ideologues could safely be ignored because they belonged to isolated and fragmented groups and were denied the oxygen of publicity. The combination of digital technology and the business model of a few companies has brought them into the mainstream where they are busy normalising racism and poisoning the public sphere. How many more livestreamed atrocities will it take before democratic governments get the message?

The kids are all right Want to Help Fight Climate Change? Have More Children. So runs the headline on an amusingly contrarian column by Bloomberg’s Tyler Cowen.

And now the whether forecast… In a paper titled The Geography of Development for the Journal of Political Economy, three economists have tried to envisage what the world will look like in 400 to 600 years’ time. Reassuringly, they seem to think we will survive climate change.

## 152, Jacinda Ardern’s global news presence was a powerful weapon – until it wasn’t

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/24/jacinda-arderns-global-news-presence-was-a-powerful-weapon-until-it-wasnt

> The international media’s adulation of the New Zealand prime minister has complicated her challenges at home

Jacinda Ardern rarely repeats her mistakes. When she rose to power in 2017 New Zealand’s newly elected prime minister became a subject of fascination for progressives around the world; they regarded her as a kind of avatar of anti-Trumpism; a symbol of resistance to rightwing populism. This fascination intensified when she announced her pregnancy in early 2018. It grew again in the wake of the 15 March terror attack in 2019. She was praised as a beacon of hope; her image projected on to the side of the Burj Khalifa. The flattering media profiles multiplied.

Initially, Ardern leaned into this. New Zealand is small and remote – publishers of international maps forget we’re down here. So we’re often flattered when distance looks our way. Someone noticed we exist! Ardern’s international coverage was picked up by local media, delivering coverage the prime minister’s competitors couldn’t possibly match. Her global news presence was a deliberate strategy and a powerful weapon.

Until it wasn’t. Many of those glowing features were written by reporters who’d never been to New Zealand. Their cultural and political knowledge of the country seemed limited to Lord of the Rings references and a singular admiration for Ardern. Some of them were hilariously terrible. And Ardern’s indulgence for international reporters hit a sour note with local journalists who were denied requests for sit-downs with her to discuss the housing crisis, or homelessness, or the nation’s relationship with China.

The last few weeks have seen controversies emerge around an Ardern biography and feature film. The outcry these projects provoked – and Ardern’s explicit rejection of them – demonstrate how the prime minister’s glowing international image complicates her challenges at home.

It isn’t the first time these tensions have surfaced. In 2019 Ardern appeared on the cover of an edition of British Vogue, and in the same week her government announced it was abandoning its high profile election promise to build 100,000 new homes. The juxtaposition gave Ardern’s opponents and critics license to contrast her soaring rhetoric and international celebrity with domestic policy failures. 2020 was an election year, and Ardern pivoted to focus on domestic media and her digital channels.

Then came the virus. Ardern eliminated both it and her opposition, winning re-election on a scale that was unprecedented in modern New Zealand politics. Since then there have been very few foreign media profiles. Her office advised me that they now turn down “the vast bulk” of overseas media requests. Not all of them: she does international interviews that promote the nation’s trade interests, or tourism, or other strategic goals; or advance her personal causes like promoting women in politics.

Ardern might be less interested in international media, but international media is still interested in her, and it’s becoming a distraction. This month saw the announcement of a film about her response to the Christchurch terror attack. She had won global praise for recasting the mass murderer as a nameless terrorist attacking multicultural liberal democracy, and centring the focus on the victims of the atrocity and their community. “They are us,” she said at the time. Now, that phrase has become the title of the movie, the future of which looks uncertain after extensive backlash and anger from the Muslim community. Arden distanced herself from the project. “While there are many stories that should be told at some point, I don’t consider mine to be one of them,” Ardern said.

Next came the book. Jacinda Ardern: Leading with Empathy was published last week. Promoted as a “major biography of one of the most important and inspirational leaders of the twenty-first century”, it was written by two overseas journalists who apparently obtained their exclusive interview with Ardern on the pretext that they were writing a larger work about women in leadership. Like many of her international admirers, the authors seemed to know less about the nation Ardern governs or its internal politics, more that they admired Jacinda; or, at least, the luminous construct of her that their book uncritically accepts and amplifies. Its blunders were eviscerated by local reviewers. Ardern, again, publicly rebuked the authors and distanced herself from the project.

New Zealand often functions as an empty signifier, a mysterious and remote utopia for the rest of the world to project its fantasies on to. Whenever there’s a distressing election result in a developed nation – a Trump or a Brexit, say – social media fills up with embittered vows to move to New Zealand. And we’ve become a popular destination for luxury doomsday bunkers constructed by tech industry oligarchs. What better place to retreat to when the real world comes to an end? Ardern has become tangled in these fantasies. Now the shining mythical Jacinda – beacon to the world – is tripping up the real prime minister as she struggles to address climate change, crumbling infrastructure, a broken health system and housing hyperinflation; complicating the pedestrian but demanding work of governing an imaginary country that actually exists.

## 153, New Zealand gun reform stalled as Christchurch anniversary approaches

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/new-zealand-gun-reform-stalled-as-christchurch-anniversary-approaches

> Second round of laws, including national firearms register, in limbo as ‘election-year politics’ hinder progress of changes

New Zealand will commemorate the first anniversary of the Christchurch mosques terror attack without a promised second tranche of gun law reform in place.

Legislation to establish a national firearms register, new licensing requirements and bulked-up penalties for non-compliance has stalled on its way through parliament.

In the aftermath of the 15 March atrocity, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, moved swiftly to pass laws to ban semi-automatic weapons and introduce a gun buyback scheme.

However, the second round of reform is stuck, falling short of the impressive bipartisanship that carried the first round of changes.

Ardern denied being disappointed at the bill’s sluggishness.

“The most important thing is we will have those substantial changes made to our gun laws,” she said. “We will be safer as a nation because of it and that will be done soon.”

The Police Association is firmly in support of the changes, which it says should have come into effect three decades ago following a mass shooting in Dunedin.

The association’s president Chris Cahill said the law’s passage was a “life or death matter”.

“We just have to get these guns off the streets and a firearms registry is a major component of that,” he said. “It was extremely encouraging to see the political symmetry in firearms reforms in the days after the Christchurch mosque shootings last year.

“But it is now obvious that lobbying and election-year politics have taken their toll on that resolve, at a time when we can least afford it.”

While the first round of reform passed the parliament almost unanimously – only the one-man libertarian ACT party opposed it – the second round has fallen well short of consensus.

Since the bill’s tabling in September, the opposition National party has flagged concerns, meaning all three government partners must support it for it to become law.

The delay can at least partly be attributed to negotiations between government coalition partners NZ First and Labour. The NZ First leader and deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, said negotiators remained a “work in progress”.

“We’ve still got things to negotiate and we’re working on them as we speak,” he said. “Our major concern is to ensure the law works, that it’s fair and that it lasts. We’re not very far away from getting to that.”

While neither Ardern nor the police minister, Stuart Nash, who has carriage of the legislation, is on record giving a firm deadline for the law changes, there’s little doubt they would have preferred the law in place ahead of Sunday’s anniversary.

## 154, 'I couldn’t save my friend': carnage leaves Christchurch stunned

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/i-couldnt-save-my-friend-carnage-leaves-christchurch-stunned

> People in the New Zealand city describe scenes of terror after a gunman left 49 people dead

New Zealand attack – latest updates


“It was very peaceful, calm and quiet, as it is when the sermon starts,” said Farid Ahmed, who was observing Friday prayers at Al Noor mosque in Christchurch’s leafy district of Deans Avenue. “Then, suddenly, the shooting started.”

Within a few, short, brutal minutes, 41 people would lie dead or dying inside and outside the mosque. Seven more would be killed at Linwood mosque, just over four miles away. The 49th victim died shortly after reaching hospital.

Rescue services were met with scenes of unbelievable carnage. Inside the main room in Al Noor, more than 20 people, some dead, some injured, lay on one side, while more than 10 lay on the other, said witnesses. The floor was littered with hundreds of bullet casings.

Bodies of people shot while trying to escape lay near doors and windows. Others had been cut down outside.

It was shortly after 1.40pm local time (0040 GMT) that Len Peneha, who lives next door to Al Noor, heard rapid fire and dozens of shots. The gunman, described as white and wearing a black helmet, had burst in as worshippers knelt in prayer.

As people stampeded out, Peneha ran inside to help. “I saw dead people everywhere. There were three in the hallway, at the door leading into the mosque, and people inside the mosque,” he said.

Footage livestreamed from a body camera was broadcast on Facebook by a man identifying himself as Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian. It shows him driving to the mosque with an arsenal of at least six weapons in his vehicle, each marked with the names of others who have carried out such attacks, and cities where they occurred.

The footage shows the gunman storming inside Al Noor, firing indiscriminately at huddled worshippers, and calmly reloading numerous times. He shot many of the victims multiple times, standing over them and firing from point-blank range to ensure they were dead.

At one point, he walks outside, appearing to fire on at least two targets. He returns to his car, swaps his rifle for a second one and goes back inside the mosque before leaving to continue the attack outside, firing on those injured and crawling from the mosque. In total, the harrowing footage lasts 17 minutes.

Mahmood Nazeer, blood still on his shirt , told TVNZ he hid under a bench and prayed the gunman would run out of bullets, but the firing went on and on. He, and others, then hid under cars behind the mosque. One woman with them was hit in the arm.

When the firing stopped, they looked over the fence. “There was one guy changing the gun in the driveway next to the mosque. He just took the gun and then started firing again,” said one witness.

Ahmed, who uses a wheelchair, had been in a side room in Al Noor when he heard the shots and people started running into his room. He could hear screaming and crying. “Some people had blood on their body, some people were limping. It was at that moment I realised things were really serious,” said Ahmed, who managed to push himself out of the back of the mosque towards his car.

Mohan Ibrahim escaped through a window in the women’s section, he told the BBC.

Khaled al-Nobani saw his friend gunned down as his three children fled. He described how one man tried to “jump” the gunman and take the gun. “He shot him straight away.”

Carl Pomare, driving past Al Noor with a work colleague, heard rapid fire and saw people running from the mosque. “And these people were being knocked down like tenpins right opposite where I was driving. I saw them being hit from behind and they were falling to the ground,” he said.

He and others, all passing civilians, set up a cordon. “We were trying to keep these people alive until the ambulances could get through. People were begging for our help,” he said. “It was a scene of carnage.”

He managed to get a father and daughter “both in a bad way” into a car and out quickly, “but we don’t know if they survived”. A man his colleague was helping died in his arms.

As the full scale of the massacre at Al Noor was becoming apparent, another was taking place at Linwood mosque four miles away.

Elderly worshippers, sitting on chairs as they prayed, were the first to be targeted by the gunman, still in camouflage and wearing the black helmet. “They were basically all shot,” Syed Ahmed, told news website Stuff. The shooter was shouting something, which he couldn’t hear over the screams as he crawled into a storeroom to escape.

Syed Mazharuddin witnessed two friends around him being shot, one in the chest, one in the head. One died at the scene and another was bleeding heavily.

He said he had run outside to seek help, but then police arrived and prevented him from going back in. “They didn’t let me come back in again so I couldn’t save my friend. He was bleeding heavily. It took almost half an hour, more than half an hour by the time the ambulance could arrive and I think he must have died,” he told the New Zealand Herald.

It was a small mosque. “There were about 60 to 70 people there. Just around the entrance hall there were elderly people sitting there praying and he just started shooting at them,” said Mazharuddin.

An attempt was made to disarm the shooter. One man, “the young guy who usually takes care of the mosque”, pounced on the gunman and managed to get his weapon, Mazharuddin added. But though he gave chase, the gunman got away.

Police later said a man in his late 20s had been arrested and charged with murder. Two other men and one woman were also detained. One was released later. No names have been made public.

Christchurch, the largest city on the South Island with a population of 400,000, was in lockdown on Friday.

More than 200 family members were waiting for news of their loved ones at Christchurch hospital. With many of the injured requiring multiple surgeries, 12 operating theatres were in use.

At the sites of the killings, New Zealanders began arriving with flowers and tributes as dusk fell. “New Zealand is with you,” said a woman who dropped off lilies. “New Zealand stands by you.”

The Christchurch mayor, Lianne Dalziel, called for calm and for solidarity in the wake of the massacres. “I never could believe that something like this would ever happen in the city of Christchurch, but actually I would never believe that this would happen in New Zealand,” she said in a Facebook post. It was a “very deliberate, cold, hard decision”.

In an online 74-page manifesto, the suspect said he had chosen New Zealand because of its location, to show that even the most remote parts of the world were not free of “mass immigration”.

As New Zealand ‘s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, marked “one of New Zealand’s darkest days,” she added: “You may have chosen us but we utterly reject and condemn you.”

## 155, 'It's a small group of people': Trump again denies white nationalism is rising threat

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/15/donald-trump-denies-white-nationalism-threat-new-zealand

> President downplays hate surge after white supremacist, who mentioned Trump in a manifesto, attacked New Zealand mosques 

Donald Trump said he did not view white nationalism as a rising threat around the world, as New Zealand is reeling from a white supremacist attack on two mosques that killed 49 people.

Asked by a reporter on Friday if he saw an increase globally in the threat of white nationalism, the US president responded: “I don’t really. I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems. I guess, if you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that’s a case. I don’t know enough about it yet.”

There have been more than a dozen deadly white supremacist attacks across the globe in the last eight years. In Norway in 2011, 77 people were killed in a bomb attack and shooting that targeted a youth camp of the country’s Labor party. The shooter said he wanted to prevent an “invasion of Muslims”.

A shooter with anti-Muslim views killed six people during evening prayers at a Quebec City mosque in 2017. The gunman said he feared refugees would kill his family.

Later that year, in London’s Finsbury Park, a man shouting “I want to kill all Muslims” drove a van into worshippers outside a mosque, killing one and injuring twelve others.

In the US, violence by far-right attackers has surged since Trump took office. There has been a documented rise in anti-Muslim hate groups in the country in the last three years, and the FBI has reported a steady increase in reports of hate crimes. Last year, a shooter with far-right views killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue.

The suspected perpetrator of the massacre during Friday prayers in New Zealand had posted online before the attack and displayed white supremacist symbols on his weapons during the killings.

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, described the carnage as one of the country’s “darkest days”.

Ardern told reporters on Saturday that she did not agree with Trump’s assessment that white supremacy wasn’t a growing problem.

Ardern also said she had spoken to Trump following the attack in Christchurch. Responding to a question from the president about what he could do after the attack, she asked him to show all Muslim communities “sympathy and love”.

“He acknowledged that and agreed,” Ardern said.

Ardern said she and Trump had not discussed reports that the suspect, Brenton Tarrant, had mentioned the president in an anti-Muslim manifesto he posted online before the attacks.

Trump made the remarks about white supremacy at the Oval Office while announcing his decision to overrule Congress in his effort to protect his declaration of a national emergency and secure funds for a US-Mexico border wall.

Announcing his veto, the president said, “People hate the word invasion, but that’s what it is.”

Trump’s claims about immigration trends and an “invasion” are similarly unsupported by facts. Unauthorized border crossings have declined dramatically since record highs in the early years of the 21st century.

Trump, who proposed a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslims entering the US during his 2015 campaign, has a history of sparking widespread criticisms for his response to far-right violence.

In 2017, he said there were “very fine people on both sides” after a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

## 156, Christchurch mayor on mass shooter: 'I've no idea what his name is'

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/08/christchurch-mayor-shooter-no-idea-name

> On visit to UK, Lianne Dalziel tells of her city’s resilience in aftermath of mosque attacks

The mayor of Christchurch has refused to commit to memory the name of the man who carried out mosque shootings in the city, in a decision that she says is echoed by her community and is a crucial part of recovering from the atrocity.

But Lianne Dalziel said the way the city’s Muslims had chosen to forgive him was also essential, and had made the New Zealand city stronger and safer.

Speaking to the Guardian on a visit to the UK before a European conference on how cities can recover from disasters, she said all cities could learn from the resilience Christchurch had shown. But she is still raw about happened when a 28-year-old white supremacist murdered 51 people at two mosques with military-style weapons and livestreamed the attack.

“I hope he rots in hell and rots in jail,” she said.

After the attack New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, vowed never to mention the attacker’s name in public. The media in New Zealand has largely followed her example by mentioning his name only when it is unavoidable.

But even before Ardern’s announcement, Dalziel said the city had collectively decided to render the attacker nameless. “It was just instinctive. Why would I want to give him what he wants? He craves attention.” And she claimed to have gone further by forgetting his name. “I didn’t want to hear his name even when they released it. You know, how you commit names to memory. I’ve no idea what his name is.”

The conscious effort in Christchurch to sideline the attacker chimes with wider arguments about how such atrocities should be described in the press and on social media. As the frequency of such attacks has increased in recent years, criminologists and affected communities have argued strongly that an excessive focus on the personal details of the killer simply serves to make their goal of notoriety seem more achievable – the so-called contagion effect.

“A lot of these shooters want to be treated like celebrities,” Adam Lankford, a criminologist at the University of Alabama in the US, told AP earlier this year. “They want to be famous. So the key is to not give them that treatment.”

During the remembrance service for the victims Dalziel spoke of her determination for Christchurch not to be defined by the attacks. More than three months later she claimed it was the defiant response to the attacks the city would be remembered for.

She added: “The response was so overwhelming that he hasn’t achieved what he intended. He has drawn people people together. It’s safer in the sense that we’re much more aware of our communities around us. There is a much clearer understanding of where division and othering leads.”

She praised the leadership shown by Ardern and the “incredible outpouring of love” from people in the city. “Every single member of the Muslim community that I’ve spoken to have all mentioned how much the support meant to them personally,” she said.

But it is the response from the members of that community that seems to have impressed her most. She singled out Gamal Fouda, the imam of the Al Noor mosque, who at a call to prayer a week after the shootings said: “We are heartbroken but will not be broken.”

Dalziel said the speech was “outstanding” and played a key part in uniting Christchurch in the aftermath. But she admitted she did not share his capacity to forgive.

“All of the expressions that came out from the Muslim communities were of peace, love and forgiveness – an infinite capacity for forgiveness that I will never, ever, ever, ever feel.”

Dalziel is in the UK for talks with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and to launch the British arm of the Christchurch Foundation, a charity that has raised more than $NZ10m (£5.3m) since the attacks. She is also due to speak in Rotterdam on Tuesday at a summit on urban resilience. She signed up to become part of the resilient cities network in her first act as mayor in 2013 as her city struggled to recover from the 2011 earthquake that killed 185 people and caused widespread damage.

Her commitment to the idea of urban resilience has been reinforced by what has happened since the attacks but has also been adapted to focus more on strengthening communities in the face of extremism.

She said: “You cannot be a resilient person if you yourself are feeling judged or under attack just because of the colour of your skin or the religion you practise. Resilience is very much based on connected communities that are genuinely inclusive and embracing of diversity.”

She added: “The very foundation of resilience is communities understanding that they have an incredible capacity within themselves to respond to any particular events that come their way. And if they realise that capacity before a disaster they are in much better position to respond better and faster.”

Asked if the UK could learn to be more resilient as it prepares for a potential no-deal Brexit, Dalziel puts her head in her hands. “It looks very difficult,” she said. “You just have to work with what you have got, but at a city level it is achievable.”

Dalziel has backed the reform of New Zealand’s gun laws but wants the government to go further by banning the type of ammunition that was used in the shootings. “He used soft-nosed bullets that caused incredible damage,” she said, pointing out that many of the injured spent hours in surgery in part because of the ammunition used. “They are designed to do great damage and they did.”

She has also urged Facebook to introduce safeguards to ensure that atrocities are not livestreamed. “It took Facebook longer to take it down than it took the police to arrest the guy. They should be ashamed of themselves.”

## 157, After Christchurch, Muslims need more than just your thoughts and prayers

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/christchurch-muslims-thoughts-prayers-far-right

> Atrocities such as this will happen again while the media and politicians create a climate in which far-right ideas can flourish

New Zealand shooting – latest updates


There is a certain profundity about waking up one morning, when your only plans for the day are to go to Friday prayers with your family, to discover that on the other side of the world people just like you, doing exactly the same thing with their Friday as you intend to do with yours, have been slaughtered.

My first response upon reading of the massacre in Christchurch was, I admit, stunned blankness. I could read the words, and I understood them, but for a few moments there was no obvious emotional reaction. Not because I didn’t care about what had happened, but because the enormity of it meant it was simply too difficult to immediately process.

The responses from many people, both politicians and those known personally to me, have been welcome. They have been kind and they have been compassionate and they have been well-intentioned. It is clear that there are many who are hurt and outraged by this atrocity. Promises of “thoughts and prayers” abound. But what they fail to understand is that we do not need your thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers may be useful to the dead, and they may provide some comfort to the relatives of the dead, but they do nothing of substance for the rest of the living. Your thoughts and prayers will not save our lives, while the actions of politicians and the media undoubtedly destroy them.

Every single day, people like me are subject to a media onslaught. Every single day, we are demonised, both by the people who make our laws and by the people who have significant influence over public opinion. And when I say “we”, I don’t just mean Muslims. Because it’s not just Muslims who are losing their lives at the hands of far-right nationalism. It’s Jews and Sikhs and black people. Because when fascism comes to call, it usually doesn’t care what shade of “different” you are. All it knows is that you are different, and it does not like you for it.

My fury and my pain is not lessened when a Jewish person is killed, or when a Hindu person is killed. We share a common humanity and that is sufficient for us to feel rage and pain. And it is evident that very many people do feel a sense of shared humanity with those targeted in attacks. Those emotions are not specific to people of colour, or to religious minorities. We do not own them. But marginalised people do have an acute understanding of what it is to live their lives in a constant state of low-level alert. How could we not? We’ve spent the past 20 years watching the world around us change beyond all recognition. Endless wars in the Middle East. Talk of “clashes” of ideology and culture. Refugee children left to die in the sea. The Windrush scandal. Rightwing nationalists given platforms that no one would have dreamed of giving them in the 1990s. There was a time when the very notion of the leaders of extremist parties appearing on Question Time was criticised heavily from almost all quarters.

These days we have racists and extremists on mainstream television all the time, and hardly anyone in any position of influence bats an eyelid. Those in power have made their position clear: they will invade our countries of origin and they will plunder our resources, but they don’t want us in their countries. They value our oil, but they don’t value us. They dress it up as “free speech”, but through their actions hatred has been legitimised, and minorities die because of it. You may disagree, but it is the truth.

So we don’t need your thoughts and prayers. We need our rights to be defended. There are many good and brave people who do that every day, but too often they’re doing it in a climate that is wilfully hostile. We need politicians and the press to do it. They created an environment where radicalism could flourish. Now it’s their job to send it back to the margins, where it belongs. That’s no small task: hours after the shootings in Christchurch, the Australian senator Fraser Anning released a statement blaming an increasing Muslim presence for what happened. Will he be condemned by the people whose voices matter? Will he be sanctioned in any meaningful way? Or will he be allowed to continue to spew hate speech?

Politicians and the press can keep their platitudes. They’re meaningless unless they’re borne out by action. It’s time to make a stand. Defend our rights. Protect us from terrorism. Use your position to send a clear message that hatred has no place in society. Stop giving a platform to extremists. Stop pretending that white nationalism is not a threat to us all. Have the courage to stand up for our rights as citizens.

Too many have died. More will die if you fail to act. History will judge you for it.

## 158, New Zealand stabbings: nation rallies behind Muslim community

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/04/new-zealand-stabbings-nation-rallies-behind-muslim-community

> As country reels from Auckland attack, leader of mosque targeted in Christchurch atrocity says the  terrorist is ‘not from us’ 

New Zealand has responded to its first terror attack by an Islamic state-inspired extremist with an outpouring of support from and for the Muslim community, as leaders emphasise that the actions of the attacker must not be seen as a reflection on the wider community.

On Friday, a man stabbed a number of shoppers at a supermarket in Auckland, before being shot dead by police.

In the aftermath, prime minister Jacinda Ardern said he was a lone-wolf extremist, who had long been known to police and under surveillance.

“What happened today was despicable. It was hateful, it was wrong, it was carried out by an individual, not a faith, not a culture, not an ethnicity, but an individual person who was gripped by ideology that is not supported here by anyone or any community.”

On Saturday, the day after the attack, she called for kindness and unity in the face of the attacks. “We have it within our powers to ensure that the actions of an individual do not create a knock on of hate, judgment and vitriol. I know, New Zealand you will be kind,” Ardern said.

“Please wrap your arms around all of our victims - those of yesterday, and those of the past.”

New Zealand’s Muslim community, which is still recovering from the country’s worst terror attack in 2019, have offered their support to victims – and expressed their anxiety that the extremist could be seen as somehow representative of the community. Following the 15 March Christchurch shootings, New Zealanders rallied to express their solidarity with the Muslim community. But the country was also forced to reckon with a wider history of racism, Islamophobia and of concerns about white supremacy not being taken seriously.

“When I heard the news yesterday of another attack on innocent New Zealanders just living their lives, my body grew hot, I began shaking and felt sick,” said Temel Ataçocuğu, who was shot nine times in the 15 March terrorist attack, in a statement released on Twitter. “I understand their fear. And I know how difficult this will be for their families as well.”

“Isis does not represent Islam or Muslim people,” he wrote. “The earth is so big. Why can we not share it? We need to learn to live together with respect and tolerance and to end the hate.”

The Muslim Association of Canterbury began crowdfunding for victims of the attack on Friday afternoon, and had raised more than $11,300 overnight.

“We are broken-hearted but we are not broken again,” said Imam Gamal Fouda, leader of Al Noor mosque, which was the site of the 15 March white supremacist attack that killed 51 worshippers.

“This terrorist is not from us and we are one against terror,” he said in a statement. “All terrorists are the same regardless of their ideology whether it is white nationalism or ISIS. They stand for hate and we all stand for peace and love.”

Friday’s attacker was a Sri Lankan man, and his actions were strongly condemned by Sri Lankan New Zealanders. “The community is in shock,” said Sanjana Hattotuwa, a researcher studying links between violence, extremism and social media. “I don’t know how to put it to you. It’s appalling, it’s whatever mix of expletives that you want in whatever form you want, to express the kind of reaction that the community has around this kind of individual and this kind of action”

“I think there is a concern … that the actions of a person, despite what prime minister Ardern said, may go on to color the entire community,” Hattotuwa said. “He does not represent the community. The community is 100% with the victims.”

“He is not us, and will never be. That’s not just because of what happened yesterday, but what is very clearly a track record, behavior, and engagement that is reprehensible.”

Asked on Friday about fears of backlash against New Zealand’s Muslim community, Ardern said: “It would be absolutely wrong. The community here has been nothing but helpful and supportive, it would be wrong to direct any frustration at anyone beyond this individual. That is who’s culpable, that is who was responsible, no one else.”

Leaders of opposition parties on the centre-right and libertarian wings of parliament echoed those sentiments. National party leader, Judith Collins, asked that New Zealanders remember that the IS-inspired Auckland terrorist was “no more representative of Muslim Kiwis than the Australian white supremacist who murdered people in the Christchurch mosque attacks. This is not a religious issue. It is a terrorist issue”.

The ACT party said in a statement that “the individual alone is responsible. We stand with Kiwis of Sri Lankan origin”.

The Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand expressed their sympathies to the survivors in a statement, and said that “stereotyping or targeting particular communities causes harm”.

“The people of Aotearoa New Zealand came together in an exemplary way after the attacks on Christchurch mosques. Our response was considered a model globally. We are confident that New Zealanders will come together again to respond to hate, in whatever form it takes.”

> Monday: Worshipper at mosque chased gunman away. Plus: Former vice-president appears to confirm campaign for White House 

Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 18 March.

A worshipper at the site of the second Christchurch mosque attack has spoken of how he chased away the gunman armed only with a credit card machine. Abdul Aziz, who was born in Afghanistan and is an Australian citizen, was inside the Linwood mosque with four of his children for Friday prayers when someone shouted that a gunman had opened fire. Aziz has been called a hero by the mosque’s acting imam, Latef Alabi, who said he believed the death toll would have been far higher had it not been for Aziz’s actions. Fifty people have been confirmed killed in Friday’s terrorist attack on two mosques. Facebook removed 1.5m copies of the video of the New Zealand terrorist attack in the first 24 hours after Friday’s shootings, highlighting the enormous challenge involved in keeping violent and offensive material off social networks. The alleged Christchurch mosque shooter sent a “manifesto” to the office of the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, minutes before the terrorist attack, Ardern has said.

Serious questions have emerged over how $1bn of emissions reduction funding was allocated. Scott Morrison has announced the Coalition will inject another $2bn into the emissions reduction fund, but amendments to the fund rules, released for public consultation, indicate there have been problems with how certain emissions cuts have been calculated. Suzanne Harter, a climate change campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, says the fund needs significant reform before more public money is spent on it: “Vegetation regeneration projects make up a significant proportion of the projects under the fund. We must make sure they are genuinely helping cut pollution.”

Despite a softening economy, the budget will be just short of a surplus in 2018-19 and record a $9.8bn surplus for 2019-20, according to Deloitte Access Economics. In its latest budget monitor, Deloitte suggests the budget is improving owing to booming company tax receipts even as crashing house prices and slow wage growth hit consumer spending.

Two million Australians a year avoid or delay going to the dentist each year because they cannot afford it, a report from the Grattan Institute says. “When Australians need to see a GP, Medicare picks up all or most of the bill. When they need to see a dentist, Australians are on their own,” the report said. “There’s no compelling medical, economic, or legal reason to treat the mouth so differently from the rest of the body.” The report makes the case for the gradual introduction of a universal dental scheme with no out-of-pocket expenses.

Joe Biden has appeared to confirm he will mount another campaign for the White House, telling guests at a Delaware Democratic party dinner he has “the most progressive record of anybody running”. Barack Obama’s vice-president indicated the remark was a slip of the tongue. There are now 16 candidates for the Democratic nomination to run against Donald Trump, whose own run will be different this time: the US president is now backed by a Republican party reshaped in his image, a huge war chest and a newly sophisticated political data operation.

Thousands of people have mourned Ethiopian victims of the Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crash, as 17 empty caskets draped in the national flag were accompanied through the streets of the capital, Addis Ababa. The funeral service came one day after officials began delivering bags of earth to family members of the 157 victims instead of the remains of their loved ones because the identification process is expected to take a long time.

Jeremy Corbyn appeared to signal on Sunday that his party would back an amendment aimed at securing a second Brexit referendum, set to be tabled this week – but also stressed that Labour does not rule out tabling another vote of no confidence; and still hopes to secure its own, softer Brexit deal. Meanwhile, the Dutch prime minister has compared Theresa May to Monty Python’s limbless knight.

A “fabulously preserved” wreck in the Nile waters around a sunken port city has proven Herodotus right. The Greek historian’s description of a “baris” vessel has been vindicated by archaeologists – 2,469 years later.

“I am the accidental restaurant critic,” writes Jay Rayner, as he looks back at his two decades in the role. “It was never my plan, because what fool would nurture an ambition to have their dinner paid for and then be paid to write smartarse things about it? And yet, exactly 20 years ago this month, that’s what I started doing. I have measured out my life in contrived starters and sublime main courses; in hours spent trying to avoid overstrained adjectives and overthought similes, and not always succeeding. I have spent months in the gym attempting to mitigate the impact, and not always succeeding. My body is no longer quite my own.”

“Iran’s threats to BBC Persian staff must be confronted,” writes Roy Greenslade. “Tyrannical regimes seek to control what their populations read, see and hear, lest the people obtain information that might encourage them to question the power that subjugates them. Some go to extraordinary lengths, reaching far outside their borders, to prevent that happening. Too little attention has been paid to an insidious long-run campaign of persecution by the Iranian authorities against the staff of the BBC Persian service. It is marked by cowardice and a lack of humanity.”

Valtteri Bottas has hit out at his detractors, claiming he has entered the new season with a fresh approach after an emphatic win at the Australian Grand Prix. The Finn won the opening race of the 2019 campaign ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton.

Manchester City were paired with Brighton in the semi-final of the FA Cup, while Watford will face Wolves in the draw made immediately after Brighton’s penalty shoot-out defeat of Millwall on Sunday.

Rebecca Huntley is a social and market researcher, involved in the “dark arts” of focus groups, polling, surveys and strangers who ring you in the middle of dinner to ask your view of your local candidate. “Often the claim is made that our politics and politicians are poll-driven,” she writes in her Quarterly Essay 73 Australia Fair – Listening to the Nation. “This is, on the whole, bunkum. If such polls were influential on policy and politics, we would have made big investments in affordable and social housing, banned foreign donations to political parties and further curtailed corporate donations to political parties, invested much more in renewable energy, maintained and even increased funding to the ABC, and made childcare cheaper.

“These are some of the issues on which this democratic majority comes together: topics that attract 60% or higher public support if we refer to all the available surveys, a basic agreement crossing party lines,” Huntley writes. “Understood in their complexity, these views show clearly that the opportunity is there for an incoming Labor team to be bold in its approach to government, unapologetic in its advocacy for the public sector, and courageous in its leadership on the environment. All in all, Australians are ready for reform, and more ready for the revival of social democracy than many assume.”

The NSW Liberals on Sunday night released an anti-gun ad featuring John Howard and focusing on Labor’s decision to swap preferences with the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party, the Sydney Morning Herald reports, prompting NSW Labor leader Michael Daley to respond that he will resign before watering down gun laws. The New York Times has revealed that information from the Ethiopian Airlines flight data and voice recorders is similar to the earlier crash in Indonesia of the same Boeing model, according to Ethiopia’s transport ministry. A YouGov Galaxy Poll conducted for the Daily Telegraph shows voters in Goulburn and Penrith “will punish the government for the decision to spend $2.2bn on sports stadiums”, with those two seats, as well as Ryde, East Hills, Lismore, Barwon recording swings away from government.

An inquiry will begin into the convictions of Kathleen Folbigg, who was jailed in 2003 for killing her four babies.

## 160, Christchurch inquiry report released – as it happened

https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/dec/08/christchurch-shooting-royal-commission-report-to-be-released-live?page=with:block-5fced0f18f0861e6ffe1e78d

>  This blog is now closed. 

Stuff.NZ reporter Henry Cooke says that the report includes “a lot more detail about [the gunman’s] planning”, and finds that there was “no real focus on monitoring the internet for terror threats”:

There's in general a lot more detail about his planning. He was bulking up on a lot of steroids and sending himself detailed to-do lists and budgets.

New Zealand’s police commissioner, Andrew Coster, has apologised for the failures the report found in the country’s gun licensing system, saying that the police “could have done more”:

We accept that, in trying to assess whether the individual was fit and proper to hold a firearms licence, we could have done more to consider whether the two referees knew the individual well enough to serve as referees.”

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has apologised for “failings” by the security and intelligence agencies and within the firearms licensing system:

The Royal Commission found no failures within any Government agencies that would have allowed the individual’s planning and preparation to have been detected but did identify many lessons to be learnt and significant areas needing change.

...

For many years, the Muslim community has raised concerns over issues like the disproportionate scrutiny by security and intelligence agencies. This report confirms there was an ‘inappropriate concentration of resources’. It also identifies failings within the firearms licensing system.

The commission made no findings that these issues would have stopped the attack. But these were both failings nonetheless and for that I apologise.”

The government has accepted all 44 recommendations made by the report, including to establish a new national intelligence and security agency, and to appoint a minister to coordinate the government’s response to the report.

The government said it will also act on a proposal for the police to better identify, record and respond to hate crime, and deliver services more responsive to victims.

The report has found New Zealand security agencies were “almost exclusively” focused on the threat from Islamist terrorism, and the police had failed to enforce proper checks on firearm licenses.The Royal Commission of Inquiry, however, said despite the shortcomings, there were no failings within government agencies that would have alerted them to the imminent attack by the white supremacist.

While we wait for more findings from my colleague Phil Taylor, who has spent the morning in lockup with the report, here is a timeline of how the inquiry unfolded up until the report was presented to the government:

Inquiry commences: April 10, 2019

Initial engagement: April – May

Communities Engagement: May – October

Information and evidence gathering: May – September

Analysis and deliberations: August – December

Report development: January – November 2020

Report presentation: November 26, 2020

The embargo on the report has now been lifted.

Stuff.NZ reports that the inquiry has found that: “Despite signs, the Christchurch terrorist could only have been stopped ‘by chance’.”

We’ll have more on this shortly.

In November this year, New Zealand’s Islamic community told the Christchurch inquiry that it knew it was “vulnerable” to a terror attack, and that security forces had wrongly focused on terrorism committed by Muslim extremists.

Its conclusion was based on the community’s own review of a decade of media reports, parliamentary speeches, public addresses, online forums and other sources:

Before the sentencing, Janna Ezat, whose son Hussein Al-Umari was one of 51 people killed in the terrorist attack, came face-to-face with the gunman in court, and told him she forgave him.

“I have decided to forgive you, Mr Tarrant, because I don’t have hate, I don’t have revenge,” she said during victim statements. “The damage is done. Hussein will never be here. I have only one choice: to forgive you.”

Here is our video report of that moment:

In August this year, the 29-year-old gunman was sentenced to life in prison, in the first time under current New Zealand law that a sentence of life without the possibility of parole was imposed.

When given the chance to oppose the sentence in court, he chose not to.

“You present as a deeply impaired person motivated by a base hatred of people you perceive to be different from yourself,” Justice Cameron Mander, the presiding judge, told the court in Christchurch, as he pronounced the sentence.

“You have offered no apology or public acknowledgement of the harms you have caused,” he added. “While I appreciate that you have forsaken the opportunity to use these proceedings as a platform, you appear neither contrite nor ashamed.”

“You committed mass murder,” said Justice Mander. “You slaughtered unarmed and defenceless people.”

On 15 March 2019, during Friday prayers, a white supremacist armed with automatic weapons stormed two mosques in Christchurch and killed fifty-one people.

Prior to the attack the gunman posted multiple references to his plan online, was able to legally obtain a gun licence, and carried out reconnaissance missions to both mosques.

In the wake of the shootings, a royal commission of inquiry into was established in order to determine why and how the massacre took place. The commission delivered its 792-page report to the government on 26 November.

## 161, Who guards the guards? Experts call for oversight of New Zealand’s terror laws

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/28/who-guards-the-guards-experts-call-for-oversight-of-new-zealands-terror-laws

> The fiasco of the Operation 8 counter-terror operation in 2007 looms over new laws and how police judge who or what poses a threat

In the early hours of an October morning in 2007, teams of armed police stormed Rūātoki, a lush green valley in the North Island of New Zealand. Equipped with new anti-terrorism powers, they stopped school buses, set up roadblocks, raided houses, arrested 18 people across the country, and detained many more in their homes for hours.

“I was only 7 at the time,” Kunere Timoti, one of the children caught up in the raids told the New Zealand Herald. “I remember the bus stopping and then looking out my window… What I saw then will stay with me forever,” he said. Outside, a balaclava-clad man had a gun pointed at the bus. Whetumarama Purewa, who was six years old at the time, told The Hui that 10 years on from the raids, she still hasn’t forgotten. “I still feel hurt, I think all of us still feel hurt, we all still feel that trauma that they did to us. Not just to us – the things like they pointed guns at them and they didn’t even do anything wrong.”

Dubbed “Operation 8”, it was New Zealand’s largest domestic anti-terror operation, involving 300 police officers. The valley they descended upon is populated by Ngāi Tūhoe, an indigenous Māori tribe who had never ceded sovereignty to the crown. Police alleged that a group there was running terrorist training camps in the Te Urewera forests. The defence said the camp had been focused on bushcraft, hunting, and bootcamp-style training to get people off government benefits.

In court, the police terrorism case eventually crumbled: none of the 18 people arrested faced charges under the Terrorism Suppression Act, after the solicitor-general ruled that the evidence was insufficient. Four were eventually found guilty of illegally possessing firearms. An investigation by the Independent Police Conduct Authority ruled that parts of the raids were unlawful and unreasonable, and in 2014, police formally apologised for the wrongdoing and hurt that they inflicted on Tūhoe during the raids.

Today, the memory of Operation 8 still looms as New Zealand’s largest, most controversial counter-terror operation. As the country now looks to expand its terror laws again, experts are questioning whether there are sufficient protections and oversights for the state.

The government announced new legislation to expand its anti-terror laws in April. The changes were introduced in direct response to New Zealand’s worst mass shooting and terrorist attack: the March 2019 attack on two mosques in Christchurch, where white supremacist Brenton Tarrant murdered 51 people. A royal commission in the aftermath of the attacks recommended a number of changes, including updates to terror legislation. The new laws will criminalise planning or preparing for a terror act, even if there is no attempt to carry one out. They also criminalise weapons training or combat training for terrorist purposes, and give the police warrantless powers of entry, search and surveillance when suspecting someone of planning an attack.

The 15 March attacks were greeted with widespread condemnation in New Zealand, and there is little argument – among politicians or the general public – that they demanded a full reckoning, from both authorities and New Zealanders. But experts, activists, and even some survivors have questioned the expansion of the terror laws, who they could ultimately target, and whether there is enough oversight for police and security forces. On Wednesday, internal documents released to RNZ found problems and failings within New Zealand’s police intelligence services that had little to do with their legislated powers. Internal communications found low pay, high staff turnover, a lack of planning, “no clear lead to counter radicalisation” and a “huge variance in capability and experience across intelligence”.

This month, prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the proposed changes would not necessarily have prevented the 15 March attacks. “No, there’s no suggestion that had the legislation – the Terrorism Suppression Act – been any different, that it would have necessarily led to a different situation,” Ardern said.

As the Christchurch gunman hunted through Al Noor mosque, Atacocugu attempted to hide among the bodies that surrounded him. “I thought I was going to die. I tried to lie as still as possible,” he told the court. “I couldn’t move or make a sound as the gunman would have executed me as he did the others. Six bullets were removed from my body but three remain.”

In the months since, Atacocugu has been critical of the state, which he says has a record of targeting Muslims – both through racial profiling at the border, and through counter-terror surveillance.

“We’re targeted especially, the Muslim communities,” Atacocugu told Newshub. “[It’s] the issue with spying in New Zealand.”

Te Rangikaiwhiria Kemara (Ngāti Mahuri, Ngāti Urunumia) was one of the four convicted on gun-possession charges following Operation 8. Today, he is an online security consultant and monitors white supremacist, neo-fascist and islamophobic activity online. “In my view, under existing criminal law, Brenton Tarrant and those that supported him in the lead up to his atrocities, could easily have been detected, investigated, arrested, tried and convicted for planning these attacks,” Kemara said. “The issue here is not that the police need extended powers, but rather that they are deeply colour-blind, and powers to carry out surveillance without oversight only encourages them further to persecute Māori,” he says.

Disproportionate rates of incarceration of Māori are an ongoing issue in New Zealand – as are assertions that Māori, Pasifika or black New Zealanders experience racial profiling and targeting from police. Without proper oversight, Kemara argues, counter-terror powers can be weaponised against Māori, activists, Muslims, and other minorities.

“When all the furore has gone away about the Christchurch massacres, and before the next white nationalist ‘accelerationist’ decides to commit horrific acts, these extended police powers will still exist,” he says.

The legacy of Operation 8 “hangs like a big shadow over the whole debate, because of how badly that whole situation was mishandled”, says University of Otago law professor Andrew Geddis. “Particularly because one of the new offences that’s going to get brought in under the legislation is training for a terrorist purpose.”

“There is a genuine concern that the state can overreact and historically has overreacted to what it regards as being national security threats,” Geddis says. He cites the example of Operation 8, but also the detention of Ahmed Zaoui – an asylum seeker who was imprisoned for around 2 years, including 10 months in solitary confinement, after the SIS deemed him a security threat with terrorist links. Zaoui was eventually released and granted refugee status after the Refugee Status Appeals Authority found the state did not provide any evidence he had committed, directed or participated in any act of violence or terrorism.

Cases like Zaoui’s and Operation 8 raised questions about police judgment in assessing who is or isn’t a terrorist threat, Geddis says. “It comes down to whether you think those folk up there should have been hit with serious criminal offences or not for what they did. I mean, my personal view is that there was a bunch of fabulists who were play-acting, and terrorism suppression legislation shouldn’t have gone anywhere near them.”

“It’s a classic problem: who guards the guards themselves?” says associate professor John Ip, a counter-terrorism expert at University of Auckland Law School. “You rely on the integrity and the good faith of your public officials,” he says, “but that’s not invariably going to work.”

It was more or less inevitable, Ip says, that there would be some kind of law change post-Christchurch. “I give the government credit in the sense that they haven’t rushed this,” he says. But as these laws expand, “There is an increased risk that it might be wrongly applied, ultimately affecting the innocent, or the curious, or the misguided and stupid, but not necessarily the terrorist,” he said.

Ip has called for a stronger system of checks on these state powers, such as an independent oversight body, with high-level security clearance, to assess how terrorism laws were being used. New Zealand can look to other nations for examples of oversight models, Ip says, like the United Kingdom’s Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, or Australia’s Independent National Security Legislation Monitor.

A spokesperson for justice minister Kris Faafoi said the government “will be considering options for oversight”.

“Regular reviews are built into the relevant laws to ensure they are appropriate, and work as intended,” they said. They also pointed to existing oversight bodies that were not specifically designed to look at terror laws, including the Independent Police Conduct Authority and Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.

The next steps will be a difficult balancing act for New Zealand, Geddis says – the need to prevent another Christchurch attack, and to ensure there are guardrails to stop the state overstepping.

“Does this change in the law, given New Zealand’s past history, cause any concerns? I think the short answer would be inevitably ‘yes,’ because all law change takes place against the background,” he says. “But our background now isn’t just Urewera, it’s also what happened in Christchurch… There is a balance. It’s just a really hard one to get right.”

Correction: This story was updated on 5 May 2021 to clarify that the proposed law changes apply specifically to police warrantless search powers, rather than police and other intelligence services.

## 163, New Zealand media put Christchurch gunman in his place with focus on victims

> New Zealanders and media embody Jacinda Ardern’s approach to deny gunman publicity, muting coverage until life sentence delivered

‘Five million brothers and sisters’: relief mixes with joy in Christchurch
Mosque gunman sentenced to life without parole


On the first day of sentencing, New Zealand’s public broadcaster TVNZ put out its nightly news bulletin. The legal process unfolding in Christchurch made it to fourth spot, behind three domestic Covid-19 stories.

Radio New Zealand (RNZ) focused its attention on the victim impact statements. The gunman himself barely warrants a mention, beyond the briefest physical descriptions from journalists in the room.

Other media outlets have done the same. In some coverage, it’s easy to forget he’s even there. It follows an unprecedented agreement reached in May last year to limit reporting of the trial of the gunman in an attempt to contain the dissemination of his white supremacist beliefs.

Just as the reporting has been muted, particularly in comparison with international counterparts, so has the response of New Zealanders, echoing the approach of prime minister Jacinda Ardern when she said: “You won’t hear me speak his name.”

On Thursday, after the gunman was sentenced to an unprecedented life in jail without parole, Ardern reiterated her commitment to never speak the terrorist’s name, saying he deserved “a lifetime of complete and utter silence”.

The coverage changed tone on Thursday, when the sentence came down and the media had the opportunity to celebrate with the victims of the atrocity.

Throughout this week’s hearing, Justice Mander, the presiding judge, had tight control of his courtroom and has banned media from making any transmissions before the 1pm adjournment. This has stymied the 24/7 coverage cycle typical in coverage of high-profile crimes, when many outlets run liveblogs of proceedings.

This means that stories only drop twice a day – and when they appear, they have already been through a tight editorial sieve, devised over a year ago by the country’s leading media companies in the hope of avoiding the spectacle that took over the trial of mass-murderer Anders Breivik in Norway – an idol of the Christchurch gunman.

At RNZ, director of news Richard Sutherland says his team have “strictly” adhered to the media agreement in their coverage. “We were never going to let him use any of his court appearances as a platform for espousing his unsavoury views,” Sutherland says.

Mediaworks director of news, Sarah Bristow, is singing from the same hymn sheet. “The coverage of this case is immensely important … but that doesn’t mean we are here to be used to perpetuate hateful ideology,” Bristow said.

“We were extremely wary of the possibility Tarrant may try to use the news media and our coverage of the case to disseminate his white supremacist beliefs.”

When Ardern stopped using the gunman’s name, New Zealanders followed suit en masse. ‘He is not one of us” Ardern said, and Kiwis took her message to heart.

Rosemary Overell, a senior lecturer in media and communication at the University of Otago, describes the domestic media and Kiwis’ response to the sentencing of Tarrant as “muted”, and intentionally so.

She notes that the sentencing has not once trended on Twitter this week. “In Australia, a lot of people are asking more provocative questions, like how did white Australia produce this man?” Overell says. “But the media here doesn’t want to centre him, so we’re only getting asides from the journalists about him, and that is very deliberate.”

Overall says she has noticed an “an absence of public mourning” that she thinks may be deliberate too, “refusing him haunting our space”.

“That muting is quite pronounced and significant,” Overall says, of the public mood in New Zealand this week.

“And that demonstrates something the public has absorbed and is embodying and practising Jacinda’s mandate, even though the journalists are naming him, the public seems to want to continue the practice of not naming – not humanising.”

Victims, too, have adopted the Ardern practice, using words such as “loser” and “trash of society” and “nothing” and “monster” to address him, rather than his name.

The voluntary media agreement was due to be tested on Thursday when the gunman was going to have the opportunity to speak in court. However, on Wednesday it emerged that opportunity would not be taken, with a Crown-appointed lawyer making a brief submission instead.

With his act of mass atrocity, Tarrant – a loner, a misfit – sought notoriety and fame – as stated in his manifesto. In New Zealand at least, that quest has failed.

## 164, Christchurch shooting inquest delayed after bereaved families raise concerns evidence could be missed

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/03/christchurch-shooting-inquest-delayed-after-bereaved-families-raise-concerns-evidence-could-be-missed

> Lawyers for survivors and families of victims had urged postponement due to sheer volume of disclosure and delays in receiving, accessing and reviewing it

An inquest hearing into the deaths of 51 Muslims in a white supremacist terror attack on two Christchurch mosques has been postponed, after bereaved families and survivors raised “reasonable concerns” that vital evidence could be missed if it went ahead as scheduled, the coroner heading the inquiry says.

The inquiry will address questions not covered by previous investigations into the 15 March 2019 terrorist attack, in which an Australian gunman opened fire on worshipers during Friday prayers while livestreaming the massacre on Facebook.

Six weeks of public hearings were scheduled to take place in May and June, in which lawyers for the victims’ families and survivors were due to question witnesses, including police and ambulance officers. The emergency response in the immediate aftermath of the attacks has not been publicly scrutinised before.

In a minute issued on Thursday, coroner Brigitte Windley said she had decided “with considerable reluctance” that the hearings would not proceed as planned.

They would be rescheduled for later this year, she said. A date has not been set.

“I know this will be an unwelcome delay for many, including those who have long been awaiting the answers and perhaps the closure they hope the Inquest will bring,” coroner Windley wrote. “However, it is vitally important that this Inquiry is conducted in a manner that retains its integrity and maintains trust and confidence in the process.”

Lawyers for many of the bereaved had urged the coroner to delay the hearings due to the sheer volume of disclosure and delays in receiving, accessing and reviewing it. Some said they were not able to engage expert witnesses or properly instruct their clients as a result.

Much of the evidence underpinning the inquiry was prepared by New Zealand’s police in 2019 for the criminal case against the terrorist. When Brenton Tarrant pleaded guilty to all the charges he faced in March 2020, a planned trial was averted and the case against him was never publicly presented.

Coroner Windley said lawyers representing the families had decried “the disappointing lack of detail” in briefs filed to her inquiry by the police, arguing they did not allow a proper investigation “of what decisions were made, by whom and on what basis”. Evidence relating to the aftermath of the shooting is suppressed until the inquest begins.

Lawyers for the police had told the coroner they were ready to proceed with the inquest in May.

Aya al-Umari, whose brother Hussein al-Umari was killed, said she had expected “comprehensive” detail from the police evidence “given the considerable amount of time that has lapsed” since the attack.

Al-Umari was among bereaved relatives who said they welcomed the postponement, but were frustrated that concerns about timely access to information had not been addressed earlier.

“It certainly is very disappointing to be repeatedly taken back to the same starting point all over again,” said Insha Aziz, whose husband, Farhaj Ahsan was killed. She is a spokesperson for the 15 March Whānau Trust, a group representing many of the families.

Others said they were worried their lawyers might not have the chance to see all the evidence before an inquest begins – even after a delay.

“I feel disappointed about the delays and I feel that these could recur during the process for the very same reasons,” said Hanan Adem, whose husband, Dr Amjad Hamid, was killed.

But Adem, who is a trustee of the families’ group, supported the postponement.

“Every person who helped or contributed to any action that led to the massacre on 15 March must be held accountable,” she said.

An earlier, independent inquiry into whether any New Zealand public agency could have detected and prevented the attack concluded in December 2020 that they could not have done “except by chance.” But it was not asked to examine the emergency response – and questions from some relatives about whether any victims’ lives could have been saved – or the role of social media platforms in Tarrant’s radicalisation, both of which the coronial inquiry will consider.

Coroners’ reports in New Zealand draw conclusions about the circumstances of each victim’s death and make recommendations to prevent future such events. It is not an adversarial or criminal process.

Tarrant was sentenced to life without the chance of parole in August 2020 on 51 counts of murder, 40 of attempted murder and a terrorism charge. He filed for leave to appeal against his convictions in November; the court of appeal has yet to release a decision.
